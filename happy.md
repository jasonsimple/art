# Lesson one: what is positive Psychology ？
1. the notion of embracing stillness.
	* replay might constitute a general mechanism of learning and memory, both learning,understanding, as well as memory, retention.
	* when we reflect, when we replay the material,we are much likely to retain, to remember what we have just been through.
2. three psychologies:
	* behaviorism（行为主义，tipical: B.F.Skinner,John B.Watson,Edward Thorndik）
	* psychoanalysis(精神分析学,tipical: sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, Alfred Adler)
	* humanistic psychology(人本主义心理学)
	
	**behaviorism**
	behaviorism looks at the human entity as basically a collection of behaviors as a box, like a billiard ball knocked around by reinforcements, by punishment, by reward
	(行为主义认为人是一个行为集合,就像一只被击打而四处滚动的台球,被惩罚、被奖励所驱动)
	**psychoanalysis**
	The psychoanalysis is about basically understanding mostly through the subconscious：that's how you understand, that's how you improve the quality of life,
	(精神分析学主要通过潜意识分析，决定如何改善生活)
	**humanistic psychology**
	humanistic psychology said that we are much more than a billiard ball being knocked around. we have spirit, we have a soul, we have cognitions and thoughts that matter.It's not just behavior that is important for understanding as well as improving life。
	(人本主义心理学认为我们不只是被击打的台球，我们有精神、有灵魂，我们有重要的认知与思想，不能只靠行为观察改变人生，人本主义缺乏学术严谨性，但引入了很多精彩的理念，比如对幸福感的研究，乐观主义，善良，道德，美德，爱，两性关系，巅峰体验，自我实现，移情等。)
	
3. information and transformation
	It's not merely about information, It's also about transformation.
	(如何解读信息比关注信息更重要)
	
	Happiness is much more contingent on our state of mind than our status or the state of our bank account.(取决于...的)
	
	covering less, uncovering more.
	
	the metaphor of the class:It's about chipping away the excess stone.It's about getting rid of limitations, of barriers, whether it's the fear of failure, something that we didn't have as kids. it's about chipping away perfectionism that is debilitating and often hurts us. It's about chipping away our ability for success, because maybe we are afraid of success,maybe we feel guilty about some of the things that we have in our life, and that in turn limit us.
	(本课程的精髓：凿去多余的石头，摆脱限制、障碍,害怕失败等，凿除削弱甚至伤害我们的完美主义,凿去成功的能力，因为可能我们会害怕成功，可能我们对过往的一些事情赶到羞耻，而那些会反过来限制我们)
	
4. soul grows more by subtraction than by addition, by get rid of these limitations.
	(为学日益，为道日损)

5. Common sense is not that common, and this especially applies to application.

6. Information is not enough.
	What is wrong is not the great discoverries of science――information is always better than ifnorance(无知), no matter what information or what ignorance. What is wrong is the belief behind the information, the belief that information will change the world. It won't.
	(错不在科学的重大发现：信息总比无知强，不管是什么信息还是哪里无知，错在于信息背后的信念：认为信息会改变世界的信念，但实际上它不会)

7. Questions make difference:The most common source of mistakes in management decisions is the emphasis on finding the right answer rather than the right question.
(问题缔造现实：当做决定时，经常的错误是想找出正确的答案，而不是问正确的问题)

8. the sense of confidence.

9. Note that it is not about helping ourselves and others become happy, it is about becoming happier. happiness is not a binary either-or、zero-one, happiness resides on a continum.
（不是变快乐，而是变的更快乐，快乐从来不是非此即彼）
# Lesson Two: Wy we need positive psychology ？
1. resilience:A class of phenomena characterized by patterns of positive adaptation in the context of significant adversity or risk.
	(心理弹性：一种现象，特征是积极适应的模式，即使是面对非常不利或危险的环境)
	
2. Ordinary characteristics, extraordinary results:
	* Optimism
	* Faith and a sense of meaning
	* Prosocial behavior(利他主义)
	* Focusing on strengths
	* Set goals
	* A role model
	* Social support

3. It is important to appreciate what is good.

4. Questions very often create reality.
	(问题缔造现实：我们所问的问题通常决定了我们追求的东西，所走的路，所过的生活。无论从个人方面，从人际关系方面，抑或从组织方面来说亦是如此。)
	
5.Foucus:From focusing on deficiencies to focusing on strengths.
让人仅能看到自己专注的事物，所以若我们只集中于自身的缺点、弱点，就算初衷再好，那么亦只能看到自己的不足，仿佛体内所蕴含优点与美德并不存在(就像忽视巴士上的小孩children on the bus)。
	
6. We see what we look for and we miss much of what we are not looking for even though it is there... Our experience of the world is heavily influenced by where we place our attention。
	（我们看见我们所盼望的，因此我们亦错过了许多我们没有期盼之物――尽管她们亦在那里…… 我们在这世界的体验，被我们的关注点(所在的位置)深深地影响）

7. I will take action and action will increase our level of confidence, and then more hope and optimism is a result.
# Lesson Three:IS happiness a random phonomano ?
1. from a passive victim to an active agent.(从消极的受害者变成积极的作用者，yes,it's difficult, it's tough, it's unfair, However, it's your responsibility.)

2. Happiness does not spontaneously rise when we take unhappiness away.(幸福不会因为驱除了忧愁而自动增长。)

3. 

# Lesson Four: A positive environment can change people
1. Study the best and applying it to the rest of us.(研究最好的，然后普及到普通大众上)

2. We underestimate our capacity to effect change because we underestimate the growth of an exponential function.（我们低估了我们可以产生改变的能力，因为我们低估了指数增长的速度）

3. Beyond the extremes, additions or subtractions to our external circumstances make very little difference.this is good news and bad news. the bad news is it seems like whatever we do, it doesn't matter, so why am i working hard in order to get that BCG job? why did i work so hard in order to get into this place? and the answer is that yes it won't make a differencce to our wellbeing, but it also doesn't mean that we cannoot increase our level of wellbeing. (除去极端情况，增加或减少的外部环境产生的区别很小,well，这既是好消息，也是坏消息。坏消息是：看起来不论我们怎么做，都无关紧要，那我为什么还要努力争取好工作，为什么还要拼命入读斯坦福？答案是：是的，它不会改变我们的幸福水平，但并不意味着我们不能提升自己的幸福水平)

4. The problem is not lower these high expectations, that doesn't matter, the problem is right versus wrong expectations, not lowe high expectations that won't make a difference to our levels of wellbeing, what will make a difference to our levels of wellbeing is if we have right vs wrong expectations. It is wrong expectation to expect that getting into a certain palce, getting a raise , finding our dream partner, is responsible for our happiness. but that in end of of itself will not make us happier, the right expectation is to believe in change from within. so these things will not make us happy. in fact, our readiness and potential to experience happiness is mostly depended on our state of mind, not on our status, or the states of our bank account. it is about changing our perception -- state of mind. it's about changing our interpretation of the world, of what's happening to us, of our achievements, of our failures, it's about what we choose to perceive, what we choose to focus on, it's about transformation, as opposed to the external information or the external success.(问题不在于是否降低那些高的期望，这一点都不重要,问题在于正确和错误的期望，而不是低的和高的期望，低的或高的期望不会影响我们的幸福水平，能影响幸福水平的是我们的期望是正确的还是错误的。错误的期望认为进入某个公司，获得升职，找到理想伴侣等，就能让自己更快乐，这本身不会让我们更快乐，那是错误的期望，正确的期望是相信内在的改变，这些事情不会使我们更快乐。实际上，我们准备和体验幸福的可能性主要由我们的心境决定，而不是我们的地位或是银行账户状况。我们要改变我们的认知、心境，要改变我们对设计的诠释，以及我们的遭遇、成就、失败，重要的是我们选择领悟什么，精力集中的焦点是什么，重要的是转变，而不是外部信息或外部成功)
5. Human nature is immutable(constrained), we have inclinations, we have certain instincts that are there and have been formed either God-given or evolutionary-given for millions of years that have been formed. they are mot going to change any time soon, not in our life time. It's fixed, we are stuck with them through good and ill. and all we can do after we accept this nature is to first understand it through research, and then after we understand it, make the best use of it. (人的本性是不变的，我们有欲望，有生而有之的本能，或上天赐予或经几百万年的进化中形成,它们不会轻易的改变，至少在我们有生之年不会，它是固有的，不论好坏，我们都要接受它们，在接受这个本性后，我们唯一能做的是通过研究首先来理解它，然后好好利用它)（Tal 观点）

6. How can i channel my nature ?(如何引导本性)
	* the permission to be human.(准许为人)
		*- The last thing in the world that i want you to think is that i experience a constant high or that you will experience a constant high.（谁都不能一直保持快乐，快乐、悲伤、焦虑...是作为正常人都要经历）
		*- When we suppress a natural phenomenon, that phenomenon only strengthens.(当我们压抑一种自然现象时，那种现象只会加强)
		*- Rejecting our nature leads to suboptimal performance, emotionally as well as in terms of external performance.(拒绝本性导致次优表现,不论在情绪上还是外在表现)

		
		
Lesson 5：
1. Happiness is the meaning and purpose of life, the whole aim and end of human existence.(快乐是生活的意义和目的，是人类存在的最终目标--亚里士多德)
2. Positive emotions help us overcome negative emotions. (积极的情绪有助于我们克服消极的情绪)
	* what happens when we experience negative emotions is that our consciousness, our thinking narrows and constricts, we focus just on one thing, if my consciousness continues to narrow and constrict beyond the threat, or beyond the hardship, and what we know is that very often we enter a downward spiral(I meet a sad thing, and i narrow and constrict in terms of my thinking--all i am thinking about is just that, ant then what will happen is as a result, i experience sadness, because that is what i am thinking about, and sadness-- a painful emotion, not a positive emotion--leads to further narrow and constrict, and that can potentially, not always, but potentially can go on and on and on,and that's when it can become depression, That's when i have difficulty getting out of this downward, vicious cycle. )(当我们处于消极情绪时，我们的意识和思考都变得狭窄、收紧，我们的目光只集中在一件事上，如果我的意识继续狭窄、收紧以致超出威胁，超出困难，我们将经常会进入下行螺旋)
	* Positive emotions do the opposite, they broaden and build. broaden and build leads to positive emotions, and posiive emotions further broaden and build. so that's a virtuous cycle. and i look broad, i look to other people, i look to other things:So what can i do now？ where can i go? where can i spend my time? and very often what that does--a positive emotion can take us out of this downward spiral, and create an upward spiral.（积极情绪正好相反，它们扩展建立，扩展和建立导致积极情绪，积极情绪再进一步扩展，这是一个良性循环，我眼界宽了，我关注其他人，我关注其他事，思考现在我能做什么，我能去哪里，我把时间用在哪里，很经常的是，积极情绪把我们带出下行螺旋，形成上行螺旋）

3. "No pain no gain" is wrong.

4. People mostly do what you do, rather than what you say.(多数人都是照你做的做而不是照你说的做)

5. 传播快乐的最佳方法是努力争取自己的快乐，因为那时你就成为了榜样，这也适用于领导。
6. Be the change you want to see in the world by example.(成为你想在世界上见到的改变)

7. Beliefs are self-fulling propnecies.(信念即自我实现语言)(例子：四分钟跑完一公里)



# Lesson 6: 
	Can we also create a powerful, positve situation to bring out the best in people?
	Whether you think you can or can't, you are right.
	
# Lesson 6: optimism
1. based on the power of the mind. 因为精神的力量
2. Beliefs very often become self-fulfilling prophecies.(信念常常会成为自我实现的预言)：
- motivation:(动力)
- the motion of consisitency or congruence：The mind does not like when there is a discrepancy between what is inside and what is outside, the mind like when there is consistency, and if there is no congruence, then we experience a sense of dissidence, then we experience disease, Doesn't feel good, doesn't fell right and we do, very often, everything that we can to get the two on par again, Either by changing the external reality or by changing our mind to match the external reality , we don't like when there is inconsistency.(一致性或相合性:我们的精神不喜欢内部与外部存在差异，我们的精神喜欢两者一致相合，如果不相合，如果不一致，我们就会产生异议感，觉得不适，感觉不舒服，不对劲，所以我们常常不惜一切让两者统一,要么改变外部现实，要么改变自我思维以符合外部现实)
4. Ways to create this consistency again:(重新创造新的一致性或相合性的方法)
- update schema.(更新图式)
- ignore or discard external information that doesn't match our schema.(忽视或抛弃不符合图式的外部信息)
- activately seek confirmation.(我们主动寻求验证：我们会主动寻求信息，以支持我们的图式。)
- create a new reality.(创造一个新现实)

5. ways to interpret our performance:(解读自己表现的方法)
- object interpretation(客观解读)
- subjective interpretation based on my beliefs:(由信仰决定的主观解读：爱迪生灯泡实验，客观事实是失败了5000多次，主观解读是我成功了5000多次，证明了那些方法不可行)
3. 《适应力》：两周训练教孩子们更加乐观
4. specify unrealistic belief：(辨别不现实的信念)
- the Stockdale paradox：you must never confuse faith that you would prevail in the end which you can never afford to lose with the discipline to confront the most brutal facts of your current reality whatever they might be.(斯托克代尔悖论：你不能把坚信自己最终会在输不起的情形下取得胜利的信念同直面现有残酷现实的行为相混淆，无论是何种残酷现实)
5. the graceful integration between high level of beliefs and connection to reality.(高水平信念和现实联系间的完美整合，maslow)：
Even if we don't success we just bounce back up, the key thought is as much as possible to attain this balance.(即使没有成功，我们也能很快恢复动力，而关键就是尽可能地保持平衡)
6. optimism, passion and hard work.(成功的必备三要素)
7. why did very often parents and people who care about us lower our expectations?(为什么父母及亲人常常要降低我们的期望呢？)
因为他们关心我们的快乐水平，他们关心我们的自尊，you see, there is a lot of belief...people believe that high expectations naturally lead to disappointment.因为有很多....人们相信，高期望自然地导致失望。

8. When we fail after coping we realize that the actual pain that comes with failure is far less than the pain we imagine and that we associate with failure. I just got over it. Okay, so i didn't do well in here, but i got over it, whereas i imagine it in my mind i think it'll last forever.(我们在面对失败后会意识到，真正来自于失败的痛苦远小于我们想象的，我们认为与失败有关的痛苦，是的我在这件事上我没做好，但我克服了，但我一直在想的话，我就会认为它将一直持续。所以当我意识到实际上的痛苦比和失败有关的痛苦远远要小时，我变得更自信了，我能应付了，我实际上比自己想象中要更有适应力，我的自尊水平上升了，我的快乐水平上升了，也有更多的成功了。)

#Lesson 7:Prosperity or adversity?
顺境还是逆境？
1. Positive is an interpretation style, not as a pollyannaish feel-good kind of approach.(乐观是指诠释的方式，而不是盲目地自我感觉良好的方式.)
2. How do we become more of an optimism?
-  take action, to just do it, to put ourselves on the line.(采取行动，把自己置于风险之中)
- the power of imagination, image sucess(想象的力量：我们的大脑无法区分想象和现实，同时，我们的大脑不喜欢不一致，因此我们常常会创造现实，将想象现实化，思想是个模拟器，想象不能只关注结果，应该包含过程和结果。).
- cognitive therapy.(认知疗法，目前最有效的干预手段：要唤起情绪，要对自己正在做的赶到非常兴奋，)
##3. 认知疗法：
### some experiment:
* Five-year Cambridge somerville study that failed.(失败的五年剑桥-萨默维尔研究)
* karen Reivich teaches these cognitive skills in two program(karen Reivich两周认知疗法训练)
* 
- 认识轴：Event→Evaluation(Thought)→Emotion
- 
###3Ms:the 3 traps of irrational thoughts.(非理性想法的三个陷阱)
- the first one is magnifying《 it's exaggerating something that happens.(夸大发生的事情，例如：归纳是人类的本能，但有时我们又做的过头，归纳过度了，例如我期中考试成绩很差，归纳为我不聪明，我不能成功，他的归纳就过度了， Evaluation过度了。)
- minimizing: the first idea of minimizing is what Karen Reivich calls tunnel vision (极小化，Karen Reivich 称之为“隧道视野”，这是我仍要警惕的陷阱:经常关注大部分中的极小部分，并以此评价整体，例如大部分学生都在认真听课，只有一个学生在睡觉，然而我的注意力全在这个学生身上，并以此评价我的课程枯燥，又或者是完美主义中特别关注极小的不完美。)
- Making up or fabricating.(虚构、或称捏造不成立的理由，不要过度个人化，或过度责备)
- emotional reasoning, the key is to get real.(情感推理：情感只是情感，不要把他与个人的现实联系起来,情感的关键是真实化（你嫉妒，并不证明你是个坏人，你害怕失败，并不证明失败是很危险的）)

how do we get real through the questions that we ask ?(如何通过我们的提问变真实？)
- my conclusion tied to reality?(我的结论和现实相关吗？)
- Is that rational? (那合理吗？)
- Am I ignoring something important?(我忽略了什么重要的事吗？)
- what important evidences do i still need to take into consideration?(有什么重要的迹象是我需要考虑的？)
- what am i magnifying? what am i minimizing?(我在夸大什么？我又在贬低什么？)

##4. Focus(聚焦点)
1. Ed Diener: It appears that the way people perceive the world is much more important to happiness than objective circumstances.It's much more dependent on our state of mind, on what we choose to focus on.(Ed Diener的研究发现，对幸福而言，人们感知世界的方式，比客观环境更重要,它更依赖于我们的思想状态，依赖于我们选择什么)
2. we create reality.(现实由我们创造。)
3. this class is not advocating focusing only on the positive, its focus is advocating reality.(本课程不是提倡只专注积极面，它专注于提倡现实)
4. just remember, much of what we experience, we co-create.(只要记住，我们经历的大部分事情，我们参与创造)

# Lesson 8: appreciate(感激)
1. 修女实验：乐观的人更长寿？
2. Two questions:
- since positive people live longer, then why people don't be happy?
the answer is the media appears to broadcast unhappy things, the media does focus to  the great extent on the negative. the media doesn't just report reality as it is, it highlights certain aspects of reality, and there is a media bias involved, a bias toward the negative. the media focuses, highlights the negative, it acts as a magnifying glass rather than as a looking glass. we need to keep that in mind, and to correct for that(既然乐观的人更长寿，那么人们为什么不变的更乐观？――答案是：媒体是罪魁祸首，媒体把大量关注点放在负面新闻上，媒体报道时并不是就事论事，而是单独强调事件中的某几个方面，这就是所谓的媒体偏见，一种倾向于负面的偏见, 媒体关注、突出的是负面，它就像一面放大镜，而不是眼睛，我们需要记住这点，并对此加以修正)
4. appreciate:a. 感激；b. 升值
5. appreciate has to be genuine. (感激一定要真诚.)
6. What you focus on expands, and when you focus on the goodness in your life, you create more of it. opportunities, relationships, even money flowed my way when i learned to be grateful, no matter what happened in my life. Because what we focus on appreciates.(你专注的东西会变大，当你专注于生活中的好事上，你就能创造出更多好事，机会、恋情、甚至钱都会向你滚来，当我学会感激，不管我生活中发生了什么事，因为我们专注的东西会升值。)
7.adaptation(适应)
Tal, what i am going to tell you now is not going to make sense, but it's true, you are going to get over this, I know you are, we get over losses, It's difficult, It's painful, so cry, give the emotions their spaces, but you are going to get over it, we get over painful emotions, we all do, because if we hadn't, then God help us all.(Tal, 我现在跟你说的话可能没意义，但是我说的是真的，你会撑过去的，我知道你会的，我们会撑过丧亲之痛，虽然很难，很痛苦，所以哭吧，把情绪释放出来，但你会撑过去的，我们都能克服痛苦的情绪，我们都能，因为如果我们不能，那只有主能救我们)
