# Lesson 1. what is positive Psychology?(什么是积极心理学？)
1. the notion of embracing stillness.
	* replay might constitute a general mechanism of learning and memory, both learning,understanding, as well as memory, retention.
	* when we reflect, when we replay the material,we are much likely to retain, to remember what we have just been through.
2. three psychologies:
	* behaviorism（行为主义，tipical: B.F.Skinner,John B.Watson,Edward Thorndik）
	* psychoanalysis(精神分析学,tipical: sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, Alfred Adler)
	* humanistic psychology(人本主义心理学)
	
	**behaviorism**
	behaviorism looks at the human entity as basically a collection of behaviors as a box, like a billiard ball knocked around by reinforcements, by punishment, by reward
	(行为主义认为人是一个行为集合,就像一只被击打而四处滚动的台球,被惩罚、被奖励所驱动)
	**psychoanalysis**
	The psychoanalysis is about basically understanding mostly through the subconscious：that's how you understand, that's how you improve the quality of life,
	(精神分析学主要通过潜意识分析，决定如何改善生活)
	**humanistic psychology**
	humanistic psychology said that we are much more than a billiard ball being knocked around. we have spirit, we have a soul, we have cognitions and thoughts that matter.It's not just behavior that is important for understanding as well as improving life。
	(人本主义心理学认为我们不只是被击打的台球，我们有精神、有灵魂，我们有重要的认知与思想，不能只靠行为观察改变人生，人本主义缺乏学术严谨性，但引入了很多精彩的理念，比如对幸福感的研究，乐观主义，善良，道德，美德，爱，两性关系，巅峰体验，自我实现，移情等。)
	
3. information and transformation
	It's not merely about information, It's also about transformation.
	(如何解读信息比关注信息更重要)
	
	Happiness is much more contingent on our state of mind than our status or the state of our bank account.(取决于...的)
	
	covering less, uncovering more.
	
	the metaphor of the class:It's about chipping away the excess stone.It's about getting rid of limitations, of barriers, whether it's the fear of failure, something that we didn't have as kids. it's about chipping away perfectionism that is debilitating and often hurts us. It's about chipping away our ability for success, because maybe we are afraid of success,maybe we feel guilty about some of the things that we have in our life, and that in turn limit us.
	(本课程的精髓：凿去多余的石头，摆脱限制、障碍,害怕失败等，凿除削弱甚至伤害我们的完美主义,凿去成功的能力，因为可能我们会害怕成功，可能我们对过往的一些事情赶到羞耻，而那些会反过来限制我们)
	
4. soul grows more by subtraction than by addition, by get rid of these limitations.
	(为学日益，为道日损)

5. Common sense is not that common, and this especially applies to application.

6. Information is not enough.
	What is wrong is not the great discoverries of science――information is always better than ifnorance(无知), no matter what information or what ignorance. What is wrong is the belief behind the information, the belief that information will change the world. It won't.
	(错不在科学的重大发现：信息总比无知强，不管是什么信息还是哪里无知，错在于信息背后的信念：认为信息会改变世界的信念，但实际上它不会)

7. Questions make difference:The most common source of mistakes in management decisions is the emphasis on finding the right answer rather than the right question.
(问题缔造现实：当做决定时，经常的错误是想找出正确的答案，而不是问正确的问题)

8. the sense of confidence.

9. Note that it is not about helping ourselves and others become happy, it is about becoming happier. happiness is not a binary either-or、zero-one, happiness resides on a continum.
（不是变快乐，而是变的更快乐，快乐从来不是非此即彼）

# Lesson 2. Wy we need positive psychology?(为什么要学习积极心理学？)
1. resilience:A class of phenomena characterized by patterns of positive adaptation in the context of significant adversity or risk.
	(心理弹性：一种现象，特征是积极适应的模式，即使是面对非常不利或危险的环境)
	
2. Ordinary characteristics, extraordinary results:
	* Optimism
	* Faith and a sense of meaning
	* Prosocial behavior(利他主义)
	* Focusing on strengths
	* Set goals
	* A role model
	* Social support

3. It is important to appreciate what is good.

4. Questions very often create reality.
	(问题缔造现实：我们所问的问题通常决定了我们追求的东西，所走的路，所过的生活。无论从个人方面，从人际关系方面，抑或从组织方面来说亦是如此。)
	
5.Foucus:From focusing on deficiencies to focusing on strengths.
让人仅能看到自己专注的事物，所以若我们只集中于自身的缺点、弱点，就算初衷再好，那么亦只能看到自己的不足，仿佛体内所蕴含优点与美德并不存在(就像忽视巴士上的小孩children on the bus)。
	
6. We see what we look for and we miss much of what we are not looking for even though it is there... Our experience of the world is heavily influenced by where we place our attention。
	（我们看见我们所盼望的，因此我们亦错过了许多我们没有期盼之物――尽管她们亦在那里…… 我们在这世界的体验，被我们的关注点(所在的位置)深深地影响）

7. I will take action and action will increase our level of confidence, and then more hope and optimism is a result.

# Lesson 3. IS happiness a random phonomano?(幸福是一种随机现象吗？)
1. from a passive victim to an active agent.(从消极的受害者变成积极的作用者，yes,it's difficult, it's tough, it's unfair, However, it's your responsibility.)

2. Happiness does not spontaneously rise when we take unhappiness away.(幸福不会因为驱除了忧愁而自动增长。)

# Lesson 4. A positive environment can change people(积极的环境能改变人)
1. Study the best and applying it to the rest of us.(研究最好的，然后普及到普通大众上)

2. We underestimate our capacity to effect change because we underestimate the growth of an exponential function.（我们低估了我们可以产生改变的能力，因为我们低估了指数增长的速度）

3. Beyond the extremes, additions or subtractions to our external circumstances make very little difference.this is good news and bad news. the bad news is it seems like whatever we do, it doesn't matter, so why am i working hard in order to get that BCG job? why did i work so hard in order to get into this place? and the answer is that yes it won't make a differencce to our wellbeing, but it also doesn't mean that we cannoot increase our level of wellbeing. (除去极端情况，增加或减少的外部环境产生的区别很小,well，这既是好消息，也是坏消息。坏消息是：看起来不论我们怎么做，都无关紧要，那我为什么还要努力争取好工作，为什么还要拼命入读斯坦福？答案是：是的，它不会改变我们的幸福水平，但并不意味着我们不能提升自己的幸福水平)

4. The problem is not lower these high expectations, that doesn't matter, the problem is right versus wrong expectations, not lowe high expectations that won't make a difference to our levels of wellbeing, what will make a difference to our levels of wellbeing is if we have right vs wrong expectations. It is wrong expectation to expect that getting into a certain palce, getting a raise , finding our dream partner, is responsible for our happiness. but that in end of of itself will not make us happier, the right expectation is to believe in change from within. so these things will not make us happy. in fact, our readiness and potential to experience happiness is mostly depended on our state of mind, not on our status, or the states of our bank account. it is about changing our perception -- state of mind. it's about changing our interpretation of the world, of what's happening to us, of our achievements, of our failures, it's about what we choose to perceive, what we choose to focus on, it's about transformation, as opposed to the external information or the external success.(问题不在于是否降低那些高的期望，这一点都不重要,问题在于正确和错误的期望，而不是低的和高的期望，低的或高的期望不会影响我们的幸福水平，能影响幸福水平的是我们的期望是正确的还是错误的。错误的期望认为进入某个公司，获得升职，找到理想伴侣等，就能让自己更快乐，这本身不会让我们更快乐，那是错误的期望，正确的期望是相信内在的改变，这些事情不会使我们更快乐。实际上，我们准备和体验幸福的可能性主要由我们的心境决定，而不是我们的地位或是银行账户状况。我们要改变我们的认知、心境，要改变我们对设计的诠释，以及我们的遭遇、成就、失败，重要的是我们选择领悟什么，精力集中的焦点是什么，重要的是转变，而不是外部信息或外部成功)
5. Human nature is immutable(constrained), we have inclinations, we have certain instincts that are there and have been formed either God-given or evolutionary-given for millions of years that have been formed. they are mot going to change any time soon, not in our life time. It's fixed, we are stuck with them through good and ill. and all we can do after we accept this nature is to first understand it through research, and then after we understand it, make the best use of it. (人的本性是不变的，我们有欲望，有生而有之的本能，或上天赐予或经几百万年的进化中形成,它们不会轻易的改变，至少在我们有生之年不会，它是固有的，不论好坏，我们都要接受它们，在接受这个本性后，我们唯一能做的是通过研究首先来理解它，然后好好利用它)（Tal 观点）

6. How can i channel my nature ?(如何引导本性)
	* the permission to be human.(准许为人)
		*- The last thing in the world that i want you to think is that i experience a constant high or that you will experience a constant high.（谁都不能一直保持快乐，快乐、悲伤、焦虑...是作为正常人都要经历）
		*- When we suppress a natural phenomenon, that phenomenon only strengthens.(当我们压抑一种自然现象时，那种现象只会加强)
		*- Rejecting our nature leads to suboptimal performance, emotionally as well as in terms of external performance.(拒绝本性导致次优表现,不论在情绪上还是外在表现)

		
		
# Lesson 5. The power of environments.(环境的力量)
1. Happiness is the meaning and purpose of life, the whole aim and end of human existence.(快乐是生活的意义和目的，是人类存在的最终目标--亚里士多德)
2. Positive emotions help us overcome negative emotions. (积极的情绪有助于我们克服消极的情绪)
	* what happens when we experience negative emotions is that our consciousness, our thinking narrows and constricts, we focus just on one thing, if my consciousness continues to narrow and constrict beyond the threat, or beyond the hardship, and what we know is that very often we enter a downward spiral(I meet a sad thing, and i narrow and constrict in terms of my thinking--all i am thinking about is just that, ant then what will happen is as a result, i experience sadness, because that is what i am thinking about, and sadness-- a painful emotion, not a positive emotion--leads to further narrow and constrict, and that can potentially, not always, but potentially can go on and on and on,and that's when it can become depression, That's when i have difficulty getting out of this downward, vicious cycle. )(当我们处于消极情绪时，我们的意识和思考都变得狭窄、收紧，我们的目光只集中在一件事上，如果我的意识继续狭窄、收紧以致超出威胁，超出困难，我们将经常会进入下行螺旋)
	* Positive emotions do the opposite, they broaden and build. broaden and build leads to positive emotions, and posiive emotions further broaden and build. so that's a virtuous cycle. and i look broad, i look to other people, i look to other things:So what can i do now？ where can i go? where can i spend my time? and very often what that does--a positive emotion can take us out of this downward spiral, and create an upward spiral.（积极情绪正好相反，它们扩展建立，扩展和建立导致积极情绪，积极情绪再进一步扩展，这是一个良性循环，我眼界宽了，我关注其他人，我关注其他事，思考现在我能做什么，我能去哪里，我把时间用在哪里，很经常的是，积极情绪把我们带出下行螺旋，形成上行螺旋）

3. "No pain no gain" is wrong.

4. People mostly do what you do, rather than what you say.(多数人都是照你做的做而不是照你说的做)

5. 传播快乐的最佳方法是努力争取自己的快乐，因为那时你就成为了榜样，这也适用于领导。
6. Be the change you want to see in the world by example.(成为你想在世界上见到的改变)

7. Beliefs are self-fulling propnecies.(信念即自我实现语言)(例子：四分钟跑完一公里)

	
# Lesson 6. Optimism(乐观主义)
1. Can we also create a powerful, positve situation to bring out the best in people?
2. Whether you think you can or can't, you are right.
3. based on the power of the mind. 因为精神的力量
4. Beliefs very often become self-fulfilling prophecies.(信念常常会成为自我实现的预言)：
- motivation:(动力)
- the motion of consisitency or congruence：The mind does not like when there is a discrepancy between what is inside and what is outside, the mind like when there is consistency, and if there is no congruence, then we experience a sense of dissidence, then we experience disease, Doesn't feel good, doesn't fell right and we do, very often, everything that we can to get the two on par again, Either by changing the external reality or by changing our mind to match the external reality , we don't like when there is inconsistency.(一致性或相合性:我们的精神不喜欢内部与外部存在差异，我们的精神喜欢两者一致相合，如果不相合，如果不一致，我们就会产生异议感，觉得不适，感觉不舒服，不对劲，所以我们常常不惜一切让两者统一,要么改变外部现实，要么改变自我思维以符合外部现实)
5. Ways to create this consistency again:(重新创造新的一致性或相合性的方法)
- update schema.(更新图式)
- ignore or discard external information that doesn't match our schema.(忽视或抛弃不符合图式的外部信息)
- activately seek confirmation.(我们主动寻求验证：我们会主动寻求信息，以支持我们的图式。)
- create a new reality.(创造一个新现实)

6. ways to interpret our performance:(解读自己表现的方法)
- object interpretation(客观解读)
- subjective interpretation based on my beliefs:(由信仰决定的主观解读：爱迪生灯泡实验，客观事实是失败了5000多次，主观解读是我成功了5000多次，证明了那些方法不可行)
7. 《适应力》：两周训练教孩子们更加乐观
8. specify unrealistic belief：(辨别不现实的信念)
- the Stockdale paradox：you must never confuse faith that you would prevail in the end which you can never afford to lose with the discipline to confront the most brutal facts of your current reality whatever they might be.(斯托克代尔悖论：你不能把坚信自己最终会在输不起的情形下取得胜利的信念同直面现有残酷现实的行为相混淆，无论是何种残酷现实)
9. the graceful integration between high level of beliefs and connection to reality.(高水平信念和现实联系间的完美整合，maslow)：
Even if we don't success we just bounce back up, the key thought is as much as possible to attain this balance.(即使没有成功，我们也能很快恢复动力，而关键就是尽可能地保持平衡)
10. optimism, passion and hard work.(成功的必备三要素)
11. why did very often parents and people who care about us lower our expectations?(为什么父母及亲人常常要降低我们的期望呢？)
因为他们关心我们的快乐水平，他们关心我们的自尊，you see, there is a lot of belief...people believe that high expectations naturally lead to disappointment.因为有很多....人们相信，高期望自然地导致失望。

12. When we fail after coping we realize that the actual pain that comes with failure is far less than the pain we imagine and that we associate with failure. I just got over it. Okay, so i didn't do well in here, but i got over it, whereas i imagine it in my mind i think it'll last forever.(我们在面对失败后会意识到，真正来自于失败的痛苦远小于我们想象的，我们认为与失败有关的痛苦，是的我在这件事上我没做好，但我克服了，但我一直在想的话，我就会认为它将一直持续。所以当我意识到实际上的痛苦比和失败有关的痛苦远远要小时，我变得更自信了，我能应付了，我实际上比自己想象中要更有适应力，我的自尊水平上升了，我的快乐水平上升了，也有更多的成功了。)

# Lesson 7. Prosperity or adversity?(顺境还是逆境？)
1. Positive is an interpretation style, not as a pollyannaish feel-good kind of approach.(乐观是指诠释的方式，而不是盲目地自我感觉良好的方式.)
2. How do we become more of an optimism?
-  take action, to just do it, to put ourselves on the line.(采取行动，把自己置于风险之中)
- the power of imagination, image sucess(想象的力量：我们的大脑无法区分想象和现实，同时，我们的大脑不喜欢不一致，因此我们常常会创造现实，将想象现实化，思想是个模拟器，想象不能只关注结果，应该包含过程和结果。).
- cognitive therapy.(认知疗法，目前最有效的干预手段：要唤起情绪，要对自己正在做的赶到非常兴奋，)
##3. 认知疗法：
### some experiment:
* Five-year Cambridge somerville study that failed.(失败的五年剑桥-萨默维尔研究)
* karen Reivich teaches these cognitive skills in two program(karen Reivich两周认知疗法训练)
* 
- 认识轴：Event→Evaluation(Thought)→Emotion
- 
### 3Ms:the 3 traps of irrational thoughts.(非理性想法的三个陷阱)
- the first one is magnifying《 it's exaggerating something that happens.(夸大发生的事情，例如：归纳是人类的本能，但有时我们又做的过头，归纳过度了，例如我期中考试成绩很差，归纳为我不聪明，我不能成功，他的归纳就过度了， Evaluation过度了。)
- minimizing: the first idea of minimizing is what Karen Reivich calls tunnel vision (极小化，Karen Reivich 称之为“隧道视野”，这是我仍要警惕的陷阱:经常关注大部分中的极小部分，并以此评价整体，例如大部分学生都在认真听课，只有一个学生在睡觉，然而我的注意力全在这个学生身上，并以此评价我的课程枯燥，又或者是完美主义中特别关注极小的不完美。)
- Making up or fabricating.(虚构、或称捏造不成立的理由，不要过度个人化，或过度责备)
- emotional reasoning, the key is to get real.(情感推理：情感只是情感，不要把他与个人的现实联系起来,情感的关键是真实化（你嫉妒，并不证明你是个坏人，你害怕失败，并不证明失败是很危险的）)

how do we get real through the questions that we ask ?(如何通过我们的提问变真实？)
- my conclusion tied to reality?(我的结论和现实相关吗？)
- Is that rational? (那合理吗？)
- Am I ignoring something important?(我忽略了什么重要的事吗？)
- what important evidences do i still need to take into consideration?(有什么重要的迹象是我需要考虑的？)
- what am i magnifying? what am i minimizing?(我在夸大什么？我又在贬低什么？)

##4. Focus(聚焦点)
1. Ed Diener: It appears that the way people perceive the world is much more important to happiness than objective circumstances.It's much more dependent on our state of mind, on what we choose to focus on.(Ed Diener的研究发现，对幸福而言，人们感知世界的方式，比客观环境更重要,它更依赖于我们的思想状态，依赖于我们选择什么)
2. we create reality.(现实由我们创造。)
3. this class is not advocating focusing only on the positive, its focus is advocating reality.(本课程不是提倡只专注积极面，它专注于提倡现实)
4. just remember, much of what we experience, we co-create.(只要记住，我们经历的大部分事情，我们参与创造)

# Lesson 8. Appreciate(感激)
1. 修女实验：乐观的人更长寿.
2. appreciate:a. 感激；b. 升值因为它能帮我们逃离险境，
3. appreciate has to be genuine. (感激一定要真诚.)
4. What you focus on expands, and when you focus on the goodness in your life, you create more of it. opportunities, relationships, even money flowed my way when i learned to be grateful, no matter what happened in my life. Because what we focus on appreciates.(你专注的东西会变大，当你专注于生活中的好事上，你就能创造出更多好事，机会、恋情、甚至钱都会向你滚来，当我学会感激，不管我生活中发生了什么事，因为我们专注的东西会升值。)
5. Two questions:
6. since positive people live longer, then why people don't be happy?
- the answer is the media appears to broadcast unhappy things, the media does focus to  the great extent on the negative. the media doesn't just report reality as it is, it highlights certain aspects of reality, and there is a media bias involved, a bias toward the negative. the media focuses, highlights the negative, it acts as a magnifying glass rather than as a looking glass. we need to keep that in mind, and to correct for that(既然乐观的人更长寿，那么人们为什么不变的更乐观？――答案是：媒体是罪魁祸首，媒体把大量关注点放在负面新闻上，媒体报道时并不是就事论事，而是单独强调事件中的某几个方面，这就是所谓的媒体偏见，一种倾向于负面的偏见, 媒体关注、突出的是负面，它就像一面放大镜，而不是眼睛，我们需要记住这点，并对此加以修正)
- Another reason in addition to media why we tend to ignore the good and focus mostly on the bad is that we adapt to what is common and what drives us, what's interesting to us is the uncommon, the exception rather than the rule. and because there is so much more good in the world, it's so much more common, we adapt to it. we stop seeing it after a while, whereas the bad, the exception always captures our attention。Why? because nature create us such that we are changed detecters, (and whenever there is a change, our mind immediately goes to that change. It's a good thing that nature creates us that way, because it helps us in case of danger. Now it's actually a good thing that we adapt on a few levels, First of all, if we didn't adapt, we will hearing all the noises, we will quite literally go nuts, so it's good thing that we can adapt,除了媒体总是报道负面新闻以外，另一个原因是我们倾向于忽视了好事，专注于坏事上我们会适应于习以为常的事，驱使我们，吸引我们的是不平常的事，是反常，而不是常态，因为世界上有很多好事，好事太多了，我们就习惯了，我们就再也看不到好事，而坏事是一种反常，总能吸引到我们的注意力.为什么会这样？因为大自然把我们改造成变化探测器，当有变化发生时，我们的头脑就马上专注于变化上，大自然把我们改造成这样是好事，某种程度上来说，适应性是好事，首先，如果我们不适应，我们就会听到各种各样的吵声，我们会变疯的，所以适应性是好事，在困境中也一样。)
7.adaptation(适应)
Tal, what i am going to tell you now is not going to make sense, but it's true, you are going to get over this, I know you are, we get over losses, It's difficult, It's painful, so cry, give the emotions their spaces, but you are going to get over it, we get over painful emotions, we all do, because if we hadn't, then God help us all.(Tal, 我现在跟你说的话可能没意义，但是我说的是真的，你会撑过去的，我知道你会的，我们会撑过丧亲之痛，虽然很难，很痛苦，所以哭吧，把情绪释放出来，但你会撑过去的，我们都能克服痛苦的情绪，我们都能，因为如果我们不能，那只有主能救我们)
8. we adapt and that's a good thing, That's an important thing. but there is another side though to that equation, when we adapt, we also take things for granted, and that's not a good thing. and that's not a good thing, because we take for granted our family that we care about so much, we take for granted our friends...., It's not a good thing. and the question we need to ask is : Is it possible to have it all? Is it possible to adapt to the negatives, but at the same time, not to adapt as much to the positive？ yes ,It's posssible, and the answer is "adapt the negative, and appreciate the positive."(适应性是一种好事，是一种很重要的能力.但是，适应性也有坏的一方面，当我们适应了，我们就会习以为常，我们对家庭习以为常，我们对友情习以为常，这不是件好事。那么问题来了，是否有可能我们适应消极面，但同时，适应积极面. 是的，有可能，而秘诀就是：适应消极面，感激积极面。)
9. if we don't appreciate the good as well, the good depreciates.(如果我们不感激好事，好事就会贬值)
10. The parasympathetic system increases when we are grateful, and that induces calm. and that strengthens our immune system.gratefulness is not just a state of being. it's also about the trait.(当我们感激时，副交感神经系统功能增强，使我们变平静，从而加强免疫系统。感激不只是一种心情状态，它也是一种性格。)

11. how do we cultivate grateful?(如何培养感激？)
- by doing it over and over again.the key when we do this is to maintain freshness.(一遍又一遍的重复做，关键是要保持新鲜感)
12. how to maintain freshness?
- One of the exercise above is that it very often becomes a habit and we lose it, we lose the freshness of it, we lose the mindfulness of it.
- variety really is the spice of life.so do it change (变化是生活的调味剂，所以变着法做，善于发现新的闪光点)
13. The key of appreciate is not just a thank you note, or a thank you phone call, It's sitting down and thinking, what can i be grateful for (my mom)? what has she done to me? what has she given me throughout these years? and really thinking about it, or really thinking a thing. Don't take it for granted. Express it.(感激的关键不是一张感谢信，或者一通感谢电话，它需要坐下来思考，我能感激(妈妈)什么？她都为我做了什么？这些年来，她都给予了我哪些？认真地去思考，认真思考. 不要视之为理所当然，表达出来！！！)
14. One of the most effective interventions out there today is expressing gratitude to others especially this one:Writting a letter of gratitude and then visiting the person to whom you are writting and reading them the letter. Cheesy? I agree. A little bit embarrassing? sometimes. You cannot imagine the kind of result that people get when doing just this gratitude visit.the largest peak, boost, spike in wellbeing when we are expressing gratitude to others, Quite remarkable if you think about it. And if you think about it further, it's a win-win. The downside of this intervention is while it leads to a spike in well-being, the spike usually goes away after about a month, It varies: it can go away after a week or after three months. But the average it goes away after about a month, the spike to well-being, so the key you want to maintain the spike is to do it regularly.Either once a week. once two weeks. once a month. Do it. make it ritual.Again, Variety, variety really helps here. But do it regularly as ritual.(当今最有效的一种干预形式是向他人表达感激之情，尤其是这种方法：写一封表达感激的信然后去拜访收信人，再把信读给他们听。俗气？我同意，难为情？有时是的，你无法想象，人们做感激拜访时获得的结果，(但即使你不去拜访，你觉得害羞，那就把信寄出去再打电话，致电前思考几分钟，“我要说些什么？我到底要感激什么？”)，表达感激时，是最让我们感到幸福的时候。想想吧，相当不可思议。进一步思考会发现它是双赢的。这种干预的不利之处是，虽然它能让幸福感达到峰值，但一个月后，幸福感会消退，时间不同，可能是一周或者三个月后，但平均来说一个月后幸福感的峰值会消退，所以保持这个峰值的关键就是经常去做。每周做一次，每两周做一次或者每月做一次，just do it.把它变成仪式，但还是要有变化，形式的变化很有帮助，但把它作为一种仪式经常去做。)
15. Here's one of the surprising findings that sonja Lyubomirsky found. What she found is that if we write that letter, we get the spike in wellbeing even if we don't send it, Obviously if we send it and we get feedback, the spike is even higher. But just the act of writting it, of being grateful, being open, that in and of itself contributes to wellbeing.(这里有项惊人的发现，是Sonja Lyubomirsky的发现，他发现如果我们写了那封信，就算不寄出去，幸福感也能达到峰值，寄出去当然会得到回应，峰值会更高，但仅仅是书写，感受感激之情，，敞开心扉，这样做的本身也有助于提升幸福感。)
# Lesson 9. Positive emotion.(积极情绪)
1. They(children) don't take anything for granted. They see life as a miracle. You know, Emerson once said, "If the stars would shine once in a thousand years, we would all look up and praise the glory of this world. But because they shine every day, we take them for granted." For children, that dosen't exist. and part of the reason why it dosen't exist is that because they don't think automatically, conceptually. they think more perceptually, or sensually. and they remain connected to real.and we can do it simply by visualizing.(孩子们不把任何事视为理所当然，他们视为生命的奇迹，艾默生曾经说过，如果星星每千年闪烁一次，我们都会仰视赞美这个世界的美丽，但是因为他们每天都在闪烁，我们就将之视为理所当然。在孩子眼中不存在理所当然，其中一个原因是因为他们不会自动地概念性地思考，他们的思维是感知感性的,他们和现实保持联系。通过在脑海中想象，我们就能做到(William James大楼里的研究成果))
2. The key is to do it, To just do it, there are no short cuts(关键是去做，亲力亲为，没有捷径。)
3. How we deal with painful and positive emotions? Sonja Lyubomirsky的研究
研究：邀请参与者谈论和分享他们生活中最糟糕的经历和最好的经历，她把他们分成四组：
连续3天，每天15分钟。
- 第一组： 写出来，写出三方面，一是影响，也就是情感(emotion)；二是行为(behavior)，即你当时做了什么；三是认知，即你当时的想法。
- 第二组：对着录音机说，讲述最好的经历。
- 第三组：对着录音机说，讲述最糟糕的经历。
- 第四组：只是去想(Just think about it)。
观察他们身体和心理的健康状况，他们的情绪和有多快乐，结果如下：
**写下、录下、想最糟糕的经历**
- 写下最糟糕经历的人事实上感觉更好了，身体上也更健康；
- 对着录音机说的人，在谈论之后感觉更好了；
- 那些沉思的人，不去谈论，不去书写，他们感觉更糟了，一个月后身体状况也更糟；
**写下、录下、想最快乐的经历**
- 写下最快乐经历的人，趋势相反，一个月后，他们的身体和心理都感觉更糟；
- 谈论影响、行为、认知三样的人，一个月后同样感觉更好，但身体状况更差；
- 沉思他们的积极经历的人，一个月后感觉更好更健康。

4. 上述结果很出乎意料，已是他们继续做了第三项研究：
there is a distinction between analyzing and replaying, when we analyze an experience, when we make sense of it, it helps. It actually helps. Painful experiences and negative experiences, which is why therapy helps. and what helps in therapy more than anything is are they empathic, In other words, are they good listeners? so when we feel like we can talk and analyze about painful emotion, we feel batter. we are physically healthier, When we simply sit down and ruminate about painful emotions without making sense of it, we get very often into a downward spiral. we narrow and constrict. we feel more sad. we narrow and constrict even more. and so on and so on, In contrast, we are not sure why, when we analyze a positive experience, really analyze it, try to understand why it happened and so on, It actually dosen't help. we don't understand why. But maybe it's because it takes all the fun spontaneity from the experience. However when we just ruminate about the positive experience, just think about it, then it contributes to our well-being. The gratitude exercise is about replaying the expericence. It's exactly that. In other words, It's thinking about our happiest experiences of the day which leads ultimately to positive outcome. so what is it saying about the permission to be human?  How is it different? Because the permission to be human is also very much related to being happier and healthier in the long term, well here's the difference:with the permission to be human, we give ourselves the permission to experience the emotions, for as long as necessary, and then we ask ourselves:"so what would be the most effective way to act now? ", and one of the most effective way to act would be to share that experience. one of the most effective way to act would be to just write in our journal. Daily active acceptance. Not just ruminating and staying there with this painful emotion. (分析和重现之间是有区别的，当我们分析一次经历时，当我们理清它时，它真的有帮助，痛苦的经历和消极的经历，所以心理治疗才有帮助，心理治疗中最重要的是他们的感同身受，换言之，他们是不是好的聆听者？当我们觉得可以谈论或者分析痛苦情绪时，我们感觉更好，身体更健康，当我们只是坐下来，沉思痛苦的情绪却不去理清它时，我们经常进入下行螺旋，我们收窄压缩，感觉更悲哀，然后进一步收窄压缩，循环往复。相反的，虽然不清楚原因，当我们分析积极的经历时，真正地分析它，尝试理解为什么会发生等等，它确实没有帮助，我们不明白为什么，但也许是因为让我们回忆起经历的快乐之处，但当我们只是沉思积极经历时，只是想也会提升我们的幸福感，感激修习就是重播快乐经历，就是如此，换言之，就是说回想最快乐的日子，能自动导致积极的结果，那么准许为人说的是什么？有什么区别？因为准许为人也是为了实现长期的快乐和健康，区别是这样的：准许为人，我们准许自己感受各种情绪，只要有必要，然后我们自问：“现在最有效的行动是什么？”，最有效的行动之一是去分享那次经历，最有效的行动之一是写日记，接受每天的行为，不要苦苦沉思痛苦的情绪<美国越战老兵受到战争创伤后遗症比二战老兵受到的战争创伤后遗症更大，原因之一就是越战是受反对的战争，越战老兵回到家后闭口不言战争的可怕经历，只有在脑海中反复回忆恐怖的事情，而二战是受支持的，二战老兵回到家会跟别人倾诉战争的可怕事情>)

5. some poetry:
- David Steindl-Rast:"We live in a 'given' world. what brings fulfillment is gracefulness, the simple response of our heart to this given life in all its fullness."(我们生活在一个给予的世界，带来满足的是感激之情，心灵对此给予人生的简单回应就是圆满。)
- Galway Kinnel:“To live and die in gratefulness, if no other virtue.”(感激地活着和死去，若无其他美德)
- Cicero:"Gratitude is not only the greatest of virtues, but the parent of all others."(感激不仅是最大的美德，也是其他美德的发源。)(因为感激，才不会认为理所当然，才不会视而不见)
- Helen Keller:"I wondered how it was possible to walk for an hour through the woods and see nothing of note. I who cannot see find hundreds of things:the delicate symmetry of a leaf, the smooth skin of a silver birch, the rough, shaggy bark of a pine. I who am blind can give one hint to those who see: use your eyes as if tomorrow you will have been stricken blind. Hear the music of voices, the songs of a bird, the mighty strains of an orchestra as if you would be stricken deaf tomorrow. Touch each object as if tomorrow your tactile sense would fail. Smell the perfume of flowers, taste with relish each morsel, as if tomorrow you could never taste or smell again. Make the most of every sense. which the world reveals to you." Take a minute twice a day to focus on what is going on around you, Take a minute when on your way to class to look at the beautiful grass, the beautiful trees, the beautiful snow." Take a minute in the evening to reflect and think about the day you had, and to write down the things for which you are grateful. Today over lunch, just by a little bit slower than you do normally and taste, experience the taste, Because it is a privilege to have the food that we have. It is aprivilege to have the friends that we  have, the family that we have, and we shouldn't take that privilege for granted. Becuase what we don't appreciate unfortunately depreciates.  We don't need to wait for a threat, for a tragedy, for us to appreciate what's all around us and within us.(我奇怪怎么可能在树林里走了一小时后，切什么都没看到，我虽然看不到，切发现许多东西，精美对称的叶子，银色白桦的光滑树皮，松树粗糙的树皮，我一个瞎子也能给看得见的人一个提示，像明天就会瞎掉那样用你们的眼睛，听声音的乐曲、鸟的鸣唱，一个管弦乐队的强劲旋律，仿佛明天你就会突然聋掉，像明天就会失去触觉那样触摸每样东西，闻花朵的香气，品尝每一口的气味，仿佛明天你将永远失去味觉和嗅觉，充分利用每一种感官，感受着世界向你展现的每一面的美好、愉悦和美丽。每天两次花一分钟时间留意周遭的一切，花一分钟的时间在上课的路上看看美丽的草地，青翠的树、美丽的雪，晚上用一分钟去回忆，回想你度过的一天，写下让你心怀感激的事物，今天吃晚餐时，略比平时吃得慢些去品尝，体验品尝的滋味，因为我们所吃得事物是中特权，朋友是我们的特权，家人是我们的特权，我们不应视特权为理所当然。因为我们不知欣赏的就会贬值，我们不需要经历一次威胁，一出悲剧，才去感激周遭和内心感受的一切。)

# Lesson 10. Change(改变)
1. change is hard. but it can be.(改变是很困难的，但是是可能的。)
2. What does change look like? What happens in our brain when change occurs? (改变是什么样的？改变发生时，我们的大脑有什么变化？)
	Understanding this neuroplasiticity, understanding how we acctually can change can make us more likely to succeed in one of the ways of successed, to actually become happier. your thought pattern follows a certain path, The experience is much likely to gravitate to already established neural pathways and strengthen it further, as opposed to create new neural pathways, which is why if we want to remember somthing, it's very good to make connections to other things, to existing neural pathways, to existing memories, and established neural pathway attracts more action, and it attracts more action and gets thicker. something that's not established, a tiny little stream is more likely to be just wiped away. as it grows more, it's more likely to stay, not just stay, grow even more. It is self-reinforcing. And this is waht habits are, when something is reinforced over and over again, it becomes a habit, .(Carol Dweck's reseach).(理解神经可塑性， 理解我们如何实现改变能让我们更成功，能让我们更加快乐：你的思维模式有特定的路径运作，我们的经历也倾向于流向已建成的神经通道并进一步加固它，而不是生成一条新的神经通道，所以如果我们想记住什么东西，和其他东西产生联系是个很好的方法，和已有的神经通道，已有的记忆产生联系，已建成的神经通道吸引更多活动，从而变得更厚，没有建成的通道，一条小溪更容易消失，当他变得更宽，就更可能保留下来，不仅保留下来而且能继续生长，它是自行巩固的，习惯就是如此，当一种做法被反复巩固，它就变成一种习惯。)(Carol Dweck 的研究，强制伦敦司机记住地图才能有许可证实验)
3. Important thing to keep in mind then is that very often the same trigger causes very different reactions. Again the world is not just the external world. It's also the internal world. Remember to the different mind, as Emerson said, the same world can be a heaven or a hell, Depends on what that experience gravitates toward. Over the years, I've become a much more of a benefit finder through the exerccise, through tinking about it, by writting, keeping a journal, by physically exercising, I become much more of a benefit finder. I have done a lot of work in that. (需要记住的更重要的事是，相同的刺激往往造成不同的反应，再次重申，世界不只是外在世界，还有个内在世界，正如艾默生所说，同样的世界，对不同头脑来说，既可能是天堂也可能是地狱，要看那种经验流向哪里，多年来，我变得更像一个积极者，通过修习、通过沉思、通过书写、写日记、通过锻炼身体，我变成了积极者，为此我付出了很多努力。)
4. One of the great fortunes in my life is that I married a consummate benefit finder, my wife doesn't have to work that hard at it.(我人生最大的财富之一是我娶了一个完美的积极者，我的妻子她不需要后天的努力。)
5. 左侧大脑负责快乐，右侧大脑负责抑郁
6. Maritin Seligman:"The belief that we can rely on shortcuts to gratification and bypass the exercise of personal strengths and virtues is folly. It leads to legions of hunanity who are depressed in the middle of great wealth and starving to death spiritually".(相信有捷径通向满足绕过个人力量和美德的训练是很蠢的，它导致很多人在坐拥巨大财富时感到抑郁，精神饥渴而死。)
7. No five easy steps to happiness.(没有所谓什么“幸福生活五步走”。)
8. Before we go to the change process, there are a few things we need to understand.(在开始改变的行动之前，有些事需要厘清：)
	- a. The first thing to understand is this: Do I really want to change? Do I really want to improve certain things in my personality things that or character, or behavior, things that i don't like. and it's not a trivial question. It's not a rhetorical question, because very often on the conscious level we maybe saying yes, but on the subconscious level something is stopping us. (我真的想要改变吗？我是不是真的想要改善我的个性，或者我不喜欢的性格或行为？这不是一个无关紧要的问题，也不是象征性地问自己一下，因为表面上我们可能会说当然了，但是潜意识里却又东西在阻挠我们，(80年代Langer和Thompson所做实验，虽是负面性格，但从另一方面又是好的性格，比如古板与言行一致联系，冷酷与严肃认真联系，完美主义与动力和雄心抱负联系，担心和焦虑与责任感联系，冷漠无情与罪恶感联系，精简与失去优势联系，寻找过错和现实主义联系，我们把负面品格与证明品格联系起来了)
9. Happiness, One of the most significant barrier to people's happiness is that they associate happiness with stacking off. Because the dominant paradigm, the dominant mantra in our culture today is "No pain, No gain." If I'm happy now, I ignore experiencing pain. It means I'm letting go. It means I'm not gonna be successful. It means I'm gonna lose my edge. It means I'm gonna lose my drive and ambition. So our subconscious prefers to keep us unhappy. so that we don't lose the other things that we value highly, things such as ambition, things such as having an edge, things such as our hard work. (幸福，通往幸福路上最大的障碍，就是人们把幸福和偷懒联系在一起，因为当今文化中最为人所追捧的，所信奉的真理就是“没有付出就没有回报”。如果我现在很快乐，就意味着我不再经历痛苦，就意味着我放弃了，意味着我不会成功，意味着我失去了棱角，意味着我不再有动力和雄心，所以我们在潜意识里选择不快乐，这样的话，我们就不会失去其他珍贵的东西，比如雄心壮志，比如长处优势，比如勤奋刻苦。)
10. ABC理论：
	A: The **affect**, The emotion.(情感、情绪)
	B: The **behavior**, The action.(行为、行动)
	C: The **cognition**, the thought.(认知、思维)
	Two change mode:(两种改变模式)
	1). gradual(渐进式)
	2). acute(突发式)
	Six different approaches to change(六种变化的方式(ABC * mode))
11. Happiness comprises three factors:(快乐由三个因素决定)
	1). The first factor is the genetic set range, we're all born with certain predisposition toward happiness and well-being, Now some people may look at it and say"That's terrible, that we have a genetic set range.", well, my answer to that is" It's not  good, It's not bad, It's like the law of gravity. It's not good, It's not bad, It is. and nature to be commanded must be obeyed, we need to look at our nature, understand it and then make the best of it". About 50 percent of our levels of well-being of the variance in explaining happiness can't be accounted for by genes, The important thing to keep in mind is that we have a lot of control what we do with these genes.(第一个因素是遗传排列，我们与生俱来就有特定的快乐和健康倾向性体质，现在有些人可能会说，我们还有遗传排列，真是太可怕了，对此，我想说，这不是什么好事，也不是坏事，这只是既定事实，就像万有引力，无所谓好坏，想要支配天性，必先服从天性，我们要认识自己的天性，理解，并充分善用这些天性。我们健康中和快乐相关的指数差异，有50%并不是由遗传所决定的。我们应该随时牢记，对于如何运用这些基因，我们是有很多的支配能力的。)
	The second is external circumstances. of course, external circumstances make a lot of difference, whether we're living in a free country versus oppression, That makes a lot of difference, However, in general, external circumstances beyond the extremes, beyond being homeless on the street, make very little difference, in fact, about 10% of the total variance.(第二个因素是外部环境。当然，外部环境很重要，我们生活在一个自由的国度，还是受人压迫，带来的结果是完全不同的，但总的来说，外部环境只要不过于极端，比如无家可归流浪街头，其实影响不大，事实上，在差异方面只有10%的作用。) 
	The third is intentional activities. The rest of the 40% is accounted for by intentional activities. what that means is what we do, how we act, what we think about, how we interpret the world, what we focus on. In essence, what 1504 is about.These intentional activities, our focus, these are essentially our ABCs, this is what real meaningful change comes, And this is where we are gonna focus. (第三个因素是意向活动。剩下的40%是由意向活动决定的，意向活动包括我们的所作所为所想，我们队世界的诠释和我们关注的焦点，简而言之，就是这门课的内容，这些意向活动，我们关注的焦点，其实就是我们的ABC，这也是产生有意义的变化的根源，是我们将要关注的重点。)
12. He says:"Well, soldiers don't cry". and i stopped crying, and i didn't cry for almost 20 years after that. Then i came to Harvard. and i started to study psychology. and studying psychology, i realized one of the things that i wanted to work on, one of the most important things that i wanted to work on was getting in touch with my feminine side, i wanted to be more in touch with of my feminine side, because i knew that it wasn't healthy to repress emotions. i was repressing painful emotions. the exact same thing happens with positive emotions.(他说(Tal's papa):"那好，士兵是不会哭的"。于是我不哭了，之后将近20年，我再也没哭过，之后我上了哈佛大学，我开始学习心理学，我知道自己想要做的，想要做的最重要的事情之一就是找到自己女性化的一面，我想要找到自己女性化的一面是因为我知道压抑情感是不健康的，我压抑痛苦的情绪，同时也压抑积极正面的情绪。)
13. And i tought about something that Churchill said, which was 'find opportunity in difficulty', So i looked for the opportunity. and here it was an opportunity handed to me in a pink shirt to be more in touch with my feminine side. But the key is to attain optimum levels of discomfort, and why? there is no other way to change, Nothing will happen, unless we bring about real actual behavioral change, and when we do that, then the sky is the limit.(然后我就想到了丘吉尔说过的一句话，“在逆境中寻找转机”，于是我一直在寻找转机，现在转机来了，就在这件粉色衬衫上，让我找到自己女性化的一面，关键是要达到最适度的不适感，为什么呢？想要改变，别无他法，什么也不会发生的，除非我们有真正的实质的行为改变，当我们做到这一点的时候，天高任鸟飞。)

# Lesson 12. Write daily.(写日记)
1. Jamie Pennebaker's experience:what he did was bringing participants and have them do the following: on 4 consecutive days that they came in, each day, they would spend 15 minutes- that's all, 15 minutes time for writing about the most difficult experiences, now they knew that no one would see it, or if they would see it, it would be without a name- completely confidential. so they were really able to treat it as their own journal. And here was the instructions that theses participants got. "Write continuously about the most upsetting or traumatic experience of your entire life. Don't worry about grammar, spelling , or sentence structure. In your writing, I want you to discuss your deepest thoughts and feelings about the experience. you can write about anything you want. But whatever you choose, It should be something that has affected you very deeply. Ideally, it should be about something you have not talked about with others in detail. It is critical, however, that let yourself go and touch those deepest emotions and thoughts that you have. In other words, write about what happened and how you felt about it, and how you feel about it now. Finally, you can write on different traumas during each session or the same one over the entire study. your choice of trauma for each session is entirely up to you." simple instructions. pretty straight-forward.if you notice, you see the ABCs in it, so it says "write about what happened", which is the behavior essentially. write about your deepest feelings- your affect, your emotions. and write about your thought and analyze it. and the control group just wrote about anything that they wanted to write about.so when he did this study, initially the results came in, one of the first things he looked at was the anxiety level, so when the results came in, disappointment. In fact, thinking of stopping the study, because he found the control group, their Anxiety show no change over time, the intervention group, the experimental group, after 4 days of writing about their most traumatic, most difficult experiences ,They started at the same point, They were randomly divided. and then a rise in their anxiety, after each of the days and during the 4 days, rise in their levels of anxiety.At the highest point, he was thinking terminating the study- very disappointed. Because he got from personal experience that he knew that journaling helps him and knew other people who talk about it, who swear by journaling, But then, once the 4 days are over, during the fifth, especially starting 6th, 7th and on days, this is what starts to happen. their anxiety levels went down. learning that they reach the same level as before, they continue to go down. and the most important thing is that they stabilized below the previous level. They stabilized below the previous levels of anxiety, when he followed these participants over a longer period of time up to a year. 4 times, 15 minutes- that's total of an hour. That's very little. and long lasting results. After writing about their deepest traumas, They became more outgoing, less repressed, less suppressed. Now why is that? We talked about it often that positive emotions and painful emotions flow through the same pipeline, And if we suppress something, if we stop something, which is painful, we are very often indirectly, inadvertently also suppressing the positive emotions, whereas here they open up, quite literally open up and allow these emotions to flow through them, they are essentially opening up a clogged channel, a clogged channel through which emotions, painful as well as positive emotions normally flow, and they experience higher levels of happiness. they are more open, more generous, as we saw also when you do the gratitude exercise. There were gender differences.(德州大学Jamie Pennebaker 的实验：他选了一些参与者，并让他们做以下的事情：连续四天，每天都用15分钟的时间，就15分钟来写下最难忘的经历，他们知道其实没人会看的，或者就算被人看到了，这些日记也是匿名的，绝对保密，所以完全可以看成他们的私人日记，以下就是他们得到的指示：“连续写下你一生中最难过或最痛苦的经历，不必在意语法、拼写或句子结构，在日记中，我希望你能谈谈你对这经历的最深刻的想法和感受，写什么都行，但不管你选什么，都必须是对你有着深刻影响的，最好是一些你从未怎么跟别人讲过的事，其实挺难得，因为敞开了心扉，去触碰那些你内心深处的感情和思想，换句话说，就算写下你的经历和以前的感想，以及现在对它的看法如何，最后， 你可以每次都写不同的痛苦经历，也可以整个研究过程都写同一个经历，每次你可以选择任何想写的痛苦经历。” 很简单的做法，很直接，如果有留心，就知道当中包含了ABC三个要素，它包含了“写出发生的事”，也就是行为，写下你的深刻感受，收到的影响以及你的情感，写下你的想法并分析它。他还有一个对照组，对照组的成员只是写下他们想写的东西。他做了这项研究后，最初结果出来了，他首先看到的是焦虑水平，因此看到结果时，他失望了，事实上，他考虑要不要停止这项研究，因为这就是他的研究所得，随着时间的推移，对照组的焦虑水平没有改变，而干预组，实验组的成员，经过四天，写下他们最痛苦、最难过的经历后--他们的起点一样，当初分组是随机分配的，他们的焦虑水平竟呈现上升趋势，每天这么写，在这四天内，他们的焦虑水平上升了，到了最高点时，他考虑终止研究，因为非常失望，因为他自己觉得写日记对他有帮助，而也有其他说过这一观点，但是四天之后，从第五天开始，尤其是第六天、第七天之后，奇怪的事发生了，他们的焦虑水平降低了，达到了原来的水平，还持续下降，最重要的是，在原来的水平之下保持稳定，在原来的焦虑水平之下保持稳定，他密切留意着这些参加者一段很长的时间，长达一年。四次，15分钟，足足一小时，时间很短，效果是持续的。在他们记下最深刻伤痛后，他们变得更外向，不那么压抑和忧郁了，为什么会这样呢？我们说过积极情感和痛苦情感都来自同一个输送通道，如果我们抑制着某些事情，或停止一些痛苦的事，我们常常会间接地、同时无意中抑制一些积极的情感，只要他们随时敞开心胸，让这些情绪尽情流露，那他们其实是打开了一条闭塞的通道，一条各种情绪，包括痛苦和积极情绪流通的通道，他们也能体验到更高层次的快乐，他们会更阳光，更慷慨，就像我们做感恩练习时所得的结果一样。)
2. which is interesting, Now both sexes benefited from it, However, men benefited more than women, think about it, why do you think that is? It makes sense, if you think about it, because women have, generally speaking again, (women open up more, they speak more with their girl friends. they have closer friends and they talk about issues.  Men still in our culture today are much more close because it's not cool to open up. It's not cool to give yourself the permission to be human, especially when others are listening, so women generally in their lives have more supports  than men, but still, even women who have strong supports systems still benefit from this exercise, which reminds me of another result of a study, I mentioned months ago, the beginning of the course, which said women generally, again these are all averages, but in general, women, or rather men benefit more from marriage than women. for similar reason. Because women already have the supports system in place. Men, very often, for the first time they are with someone, who they feel comfortably enough opening up to. again, both males and females benefit from a long-term relationship, but men generally tend to benefit more than women.(接上段：有趣的是，会有性别差异，男女都从中受益（写日记），但男士比女士受益的更多，试想一下，为什么会这样，仔细想想，其实不无道理，受益的女士，状况大大改善，但男士受益更多，为什么？因为一般来说，女士敞开的更多，他们和女伴谈得更多，他们有密友，并对他们倾诉一切，而在今天的文化中，男士还是比较保守，因为找人倾诉有点没面子，准许自己为人，不是一件很酷的事，尤其是有其他人在旁时，因此，在生活中，女士们比男士们更容易获得支持，但是尽管如此，拥有强大支持的女士，仍能从这项练习中获益，这让我想起另一项研究的结果，我几个月前提到过，在课程开始时，提到一般来说，男人在婚姻中比女人受益更多，类似的原因，因为女士们原来就有支持系统，而男人，通常这是他们第一次遇到一个让他们觉得能安心倾诉的人，同样，尽管男女都在长期的恋爱关系中获益，但还是男士受益比女士多，)
3. Laura King, a student of pennebaker, took the exact opposite approach and said:"Let's study to see what happens when the individuals write about their most intensive positive experience." what she did specifically was taking the instructions from Abraham Maslow's work on peak experience. and here are the instructions: Once again, this was three times, 15 minutes, so 45 minutes total on three consecutive days. Think of the most wonderful experience or experiences in your life, happiest moments, ecstatic moments, moments of rapture, perhaps from being in love, or from listening to music, or suddenly 'being hit', by a book or painting or from some great creative moment. choose one such experience or moment. Try to imagine yourself at that moment, including all the feelings and emotions associated with the experience. Now write about the experience in as much detail as possible, try to include the feelings, thoughts, and emotions that were present at the time. please try your best to re-experience the emotions involved. Essentially the exact opposite of Pennebaker. Results? Identical, Those who wrote about their peak experiences, their best experiences visit doctors less, in other words, it strengthened their physiological immune system, and experienced more happiness. so both psychological and physiological results. " Now when you look at this, some of you may be thinking that "well, what about the Lyubomirsky study? That said when you write about positive emotions. Actually you feel worse. whereas you write about negative emotions, you do feel better as Pennebaker suggested. Here's the difference. The instructions that Laura King gave were mostly about describing and re-experiencing, replaying your experience. It wasn't about analyzing "why did it happen", "how did it ", it was rather how it happen, in other words, replaying it. When the instructions and this is the Lyubomirsky study, were analyze the experience:why it happened, how did you get there and so on and so on. That's why it had the negative consequences over time, but just replaying the experience, just writing about how wonderful it is, re-experiencing emotionally what that was actually let you benefit.( Laura King的实验： Laura King 是 pennebaker 的学生，用相反的方法来做这项研究，她说：“我们来研究一下，看当人们写下最快乐的经历时会有怎么样的结果”，她的做法明确地根据 Abraham Maslow 关于巅峰经验的研究. 以下就是做法，三次，每次15分钟，连续三天，总共45分钟，想出生命中最精彩的经历，或多次美好的经历，快乐，兴奋的时刻，或坠入爱河极度欢喜的时刻，或者听音乐的欢快时刻，或突然发现一本好书或好画或突然灵感乍现，选择其中一个这样的时刻，想象自己正经历着一时刻，沉浸在所有与这一经历相关的感受和情感中，尽量详细地写下这一次经历，尽量写下感受和想法及当时产生的情感，尽量尝试重新经历那些情感。这个做法和Pennebaker 的做法相反，结果呢？完全一样，那些写下他们巅峰经验的人，写下最快乐经历的人，去看医生的次数少了，就是说，这个做法增强了他们的身体免疫系统，让他们体验更多快乐，不论心理还是身体上都得到同样的效果。现在来看，你们有些人可能会想，那Lyubomirsky的研究呢？那项研究表示，当你写下积极情感时，其实你感觉更糟，而写下负面情感，都会如Pennebaker所说，感觉会好些，不同之处在于，Laura King 的做法主要是描述和重新体验，重现你的经历，而不是分析“怎么会发生这种情况”，而是它的发生过程，就是重现，而Lyubomirsky的研究是分析这种经历，为什么会发生，你为什么会遇上之类的，这就是为什么随着时间推移，会产生负面的效果，但至少重现经历，只写下这次经历有多美好，重新体验当时的情感，实际上会让你受益。)
4. 写日记，分析痛苦的经历能让人减轻焦虑感，重现美好的经历能让人更快乐。
5. Why are there such remarkable benefits to journaling?(为什么写日记能产生如此显著的好处？)
Let's understand the process,the mechanism.So there are a few things that are at play here.One of the things for example with positive emotions is that when you are replaying it,you are simply, you are fortifying the neural pathways. You replay,you imagine it again, and you make it more likely to happen again. Just like when you have a river, remember the analogy from two weeks ago,you have a river, and the more water go through it,then the wider it becomes, and then the more water is likely to go into it. That's self-reinforcing nature of change.So the first thing, the first reason why writing especially about painful emotions, but not just painful emotions, the reason why it helps is because of tension. We talked about ironic processing- Daniel Wegner's work from here, when we suppress unnatural phenomenon,it often intensifies. Be it thinking about a pink elephant, or be it suppressing painful emotions. And when we give ourselves the permission to be human, we are much more likely to release it,to let go, which is why therapy helps,which is why sharing with friends, opening up helps,which is why journaling helps. This is the whole idea of suppression or repression. The second thing that Pennebaker talks about is coherence. One of the things that he finds is that the individuals who benefit most,and he analyzes the test, confidentially of course,but he analyzes the test. Individuals who benefit most from the study are once introduced a lot of insight words,or insight phrases, meaning by the third day,they are all writing "now I see that" or "I understand that". or "it just dawned on me that" or "I realize that". Those who have many of these words or phrases in their writings are the ones who benefited the most. In other words, they've created a sense of coherence out of the experience. They make sense out of something perhaps before that was senseless. In other words,they created a story around their experiences. It's no longer dispersed,disjointed,disconnected data. Now it is a coherent whole.It's a story. Now I can deal with it. And if you think about it,what do people mostly remember? People mostly remember stories. Why? Because you remember a story, because it's one unit- it's a whole. The exact same here. We want to feel that our lives have a sense of coherence that we can make sense of them. Pennebaker: "An artifact of our ambiguous and unpredictable world is the anxiety of not attaining completion and not understanding a simple cause-and-effect explanation for traumatic disturbances. Alas,we naturally search for meaning and the completion of events; it gives us a sense of control and predictability over our lives." Again,that's why therapy helps, because we create coherence out of experience. This is why there was far less post-traumatic stress disorder after the Holocaust after there was the Vietnam war. Because after the Holocaust,they spoke about these experiences. They created a story around it,a tragic one, but still there was a sense of coherence,as opposed to Vietnam,where there was just random flashes of experiences without giving themselves permission,or without society, in many ways,giving them the permission to open up and to create a story out of it that they could hand, they could grasp.(我们来理解一下这个过程当中的原理，现在有几件事情在这里起作用，例如你带着积极情感，在回想其中一次经历，你其实是在增强神经通路，你再次重现、想象它，让它像重新发生一样，就像你面前有条河，记得两周前的类推法吗，你面前有条河，流过的水越多，它就变得越宽阔，然后越来越多水流进去，这是变化的本质：自我实现。因此，为什么写下，尤其是痛苦情感，但也不只是痛苦情感，之所以有所帮助是因为紧张感。我们之前讲过Daniel Wegner的"反语处理"，而他谈到，当我们抑制非自然现象时，通常会适得其反，比如想像一头粉红色的大象，或抑制痛苦的情感，当我们准许自己为人，我们都倾向于释放感情、放开心胸，这就是治疗产生作用的原因，就是为什么和朋友分享、与人倾诉以及写日记能有所帮助，这就是抑制或压抑的概念，Pennebaker所说的另一件事是关联性，他发现的其中一件事是，那些受益最大的人，从这项研究受益最多的人，都使用了一些领悟性的词语或词组，也就是说到了第三天他们都开始写到："现在我知道了"或者"我明白了"，"我突然明白了"或"我意识到"，日记里提及到这些词或短语的次数最多的人，就是受益最大的人，换句话说，他们已从这经历中创造出一种关联性，他们从某些事当中得到了启示，这些事情以前也许是毫无意义的，也就是说，他们围绕着他们的经历创造出故事，这经历已不再是零散的、无关的片段，现在已经是一个连贯、完整的故事，现在我可以面对它了。仔细想想，人们通常最记得的是什么?他们最记得的是故事，为什么?你能记住一个故事？是因为它是一个整体，而同样的道理，我们想感受到我们的生命的关联性，让生命变得有意义。Pennebaker说"我们模糊且无可预知的世界的产物之一就是对不能完满成功而产生的焦虑和无法理解对一些造成痛苦困扰的缘由的简单解释。"我们自然地去寻找事件的意义和完满性，它让我们有了对生命的控制以及预知能力，这再次说明了疗法能起作用的原因，因为我们从经验中创造出关联性，这就是大屠杀造成的创伤后遗症远少于越南战争造成的创伤后遗症的原因，因为在大屠杀之后，士兵们说出了这次经历，他们围绕这次经历讲出一个故事，虽然悲惨，但还是会有关联性。和越战的经历不同，对于越战，他们只有一些零散的记忆，并没有准许自己为人，也没有这样的社会环境或其他途径让他们尽情倾诉，来说出一个他们可以应付、可以接受的故事。
6. three components:(Aaron Antonovsky 发现的三要素)
 * sense of comprehensibility―― I understand the world. It make sense to me. I see. I realize. I get it. The world and event, difficulties and hardships, highs and lows make sense to me mostly. （第一，理解能力：我能理解世界，世界对我很重要，我看得到，感觉的到，理解的了，世界、事件、困难、挫折、生活的高低起伏对我来说是宝贵经历。）
 * sense of manageability―― I can deal with it, i can handle it. I have the internal as well as external resources to deal with it. as opposed to being helpless. This is a sense of efficacy, of confidence being able to deal with the hardships that arise. （第二，掌控（管理）能力：我可以处理的了，能承受的了，我能利用各种内部和外部资源处理事情，而不是孤立无援，这是一种能效，一种自信，能够处理突如其来的困难。）
 * sense of meaningfulness―― according to Antonovsky, that makes up the sense of coherence, This was not in vain-this difficulty, This disagreement with my partner was not for nothing, because we understand one another better now. And we are even close, more intimate. This failure was not in vain. I have learned from it, and i have grown from it, This mistake has reason. again, not necessarily happen for the best, but learning how to make the best of what happens.（第三，意义性：如Antonovsky所说，能够产生关联性的，意义性，困难的出现不适毫无意义的，我和伴侣意见不合不适坏事，因为通过这件事，我们更了解了对方，我们会变得更亲密，我们之间的冲突是有意义的，我已经从中学习到东西，并得到成长，这个错误是有原因的，再次强调，这件事的发生不一定是好的，但可以学习如何在事情发生后用最好的方法解决）
 
 7. a sense of coherence is a global orientation that expresses the external, the extent to which one has a pervasive, enduring though dynamic felling of confidence that: (关联感：是一种整体适应性，对生活的感受性和信心主要包含三个方面：(Pennebaker 和 Antonovsky)):
 * the stimuli deriving from one's  and external environments in the course of living are structured, predictable and explicable(comprehensible, in other words);(第一，在生命中个体感受到来自内外部环境的压力，是明确、具体、可预测的（即领悟性）)；
 * the resources are available to one to meet the demands posed by these stimuli(internal resources and external resources(I can deal with it, I can manage);（第二，个体感受到应对内外部环境压力所需资源是充分的，可以利用的（即可控性））
 * these demands are challenges worthy of investment and engagement(it's meaningful).（第三，个体感受到来自内外部环境的压力具有挑战性，值得花时间和精力去应对。）
 
# Lesson 12. Setting goals(设定目标)
1. Abraham Maslow:" Being focused on a task produces organization for efficiency both within the organism and in the environment."(专注于一个任务可以在个体及自然环境中提高组织效率。)
2. Goals contribute to performance and well-being because they strengthen our resilience.(目标对工作表现及幸福感有重大影响，因为目标会让我们更具适应力)
3. Nietzsche once wrote that if we have a what for, every how becomes possible.(尼采曾写道，只要我们有目标，一切皆有可能。)
4. Goals make us more successful, What we are doing with goals with declaring that we believe we are going to get something. because our mind doesn't like when the reason inconsistency between what is inside and what is outside. It wants there to be match. And if i believe in a goal and i declare a goal, the outside is likely to match that. (目标让我们更成功，就跟积极信念发挥作用的原因一样，有目标就代表我们相信我们会得到某样东西。因为我们的思维不喜欢内部和外部不一致，而希望能相一致，如果我相信一个目标，对外宣告这个目标，那外部事物就会趋向于与这个目标相一致。)
5. The power of the word:words create the world. what words do is essentially create an image in our minds, especially when we imagine the goal. It creates an image im our mind and the mind doesn't know the difference between the imaginary and the real and the mind wants consistency-- that is what goals do. They help us create consistency. (言语的力量：言语创造世界，基本上，言语能在我们的脑海中塑造一幅画面，尤其是我们想象目标时，它在我们脑海中创造一幅画面，而我们并没有意识到该想象和现实之间的差距，我们的思维想让两者统一，目标就是这样起作用。它们让我们更容易让两者统一。)
6. W.H.Murray:"Concerning all acts of creation there is one elementary truth, the ignorance of which kills countless ideas and splendid ppans: That the moment one defnitely commits oneself, then providence moves too. All sorts of things occur to help one that would not have otherwise occurred. A whole stream of events issues from the decision, raising in one's favor all manner of unforeseen incidents and meetings and material assistance which no man would have dreamed would come his way, I have learned a deep respect for one of Goethe's couplets: Whatever you can do, or dream you can, begin it！ Boldness has genius, magic, and power in it. Why it works, how it works--we are not really sure, but it works. Just like when you declare you are looking for computer, suddenly you see all these opportunities. the same with commitments. when we commit, things begin to happen. we begin to identify external resources as well as internal resources. Things that we didn't see before. Because my question becomes "How can i succeed?" and then children on the bus, or the time on the clock suddenly become visible to us, and we are able to succeed... much more likely to succeed than before. Words create worlds. (W.H.Murray: 在所有创造的过程中都有一个基本真理，对它的忽视使得无数优秀创意的计划夭折，那就是一个人一旦全身心投入，就会触动冥冥中的天意，很多帮助他实现目标的事，若非这样也不会发生，这样的决定会带来一系列事件，各种意料之外，对他有所帮助的事件，人和事物，这完全是他之前没有想到的，从歌德的诗文中我有深刻体会：无论你能做什么或梦想什么，去做吧，勇敢带来智慧，魔力和力量，它为什么会起作用，如何起作用，我们不确定，反正就是有用，就像是如果你说要买电脑，就会看到很多机会，投入也是同样的道理，我们投入了，很多事就会接踵而来，我们开始发现外部资源，以及内部资源，会发现之前没看到的东西，因为我的问题变成了“我怎样能成功?” 然后车上的孩子，或时钟的时间忽然变得清晰可见，我们有能力成功，比以前更有可能成功――言语创造世界。)
7. Goals properly understood lead to happiness. And i emphasize "properly understood". Why? Because we know that attaining goals, the attainment of goals does not in and itself lead to happiness. yes, getting tenure will lead to a spike of my well being, but very quickly I'll go back to my base level. It will not lead to long lasting happiness. So that's temporary-- we know that attainment of goals does not lead to happiness. what does lead to happiness? **Understanding the proper role of goals. and understanding that it's not the attaining of a goal that leads to happiness, but the having of a goal that leads to happiness**.(被正确理解的目标会让人幸福，这里我强调“被正确理解”，为什么？因为我们知道实现目标，实现目标本身并不会带来幸福，没错，得到职位我会有短暂的幸福，但很快我就会回归基础水平，它不会带来长期的持续的幸福，我们知道那是短暂的快乐，因此我们知道实现目标不会带来幸福，那什么能带来幸福？**充分理解目标的正确作用，要明白到，不是实现目标带来幸福，而是拥有目标让人幸福。**)
8. Goals properly understood their role is to liberate us to enjoy the present. what does this mean? Let's say you go off on a road trip, and you have no idea where you are going. you don't have a goal. You don't have a destination in mind. you are less likely rather than more likely to enjoy the journey. Because every minute you will look left or right or ahead to see if you are not falling over the stage; whereas if you know where you are going, you have a sense of direction. you are liberated. you are much more likely to enjoy the process, the flower on the side as well. this also explains why so many people when thy retire, become less happy, even though they've been dreaming of being retired for many years, when they actually retire, they become less happy. the ones who are happier when they retire are the ones who actually set goals for themselves, whether it's taking a class, whether it's learning something new, whether it's spending more time with family and friends, but they have a goal, as opposed to "let's just enjoy ourselves. let's just be". we need that goal-- this outcome, this future orentation, so that we can enjoy the present more. the goals liberate us to enjoy the here and now. In other words, if you think about it, the role of goals is actually means,  thy are means toward an end, and the end are the present experiences. (被正确理解的目标的作用是解放我们，让我们享受当下，这意味着什么？例如你去远足，你不知道自己要去哪，你没目标，心中没有方向，你就不大可能享受旅程，因为每分钟你都在左顾右盼，不知道是否错过什么，如果你知道要去哪，你有方向感，你就被解放了，你就更可能享受旅程，才可以欣赏到路边的鲜花。这也能解释为什么很多人退休后，变得不大开心，尽管他们多年来一直期待着退休，到他们真的退休后，就变得闷闷不乐，那些退休后更开心的人，为自己设定了目标，或是上一门课，或是学新知识，或是和亲人朋友相处更久，他们都有一个目标，而不是“让我们享受生活吧，顺其自然”。我们需要目标，结果，未来的导向，那样我们就能更享受此刻，目标让我们得到解放，才能享受当下。换言之，如果你仔细想想，目标是一种手段，他们是达到结果的一种手段，结果就是当下的体验。)
9. **Goals are means toward the present end**, This explains why so many high achievements are unhappy, and turn to drugs and to alcohol, going to rehab centers constantly, coming out and going back, and we ask ourselves"why? how could it be?" Those people who seemingly have it all, Fame, fortune, beauty, Anyone thay want, the life that most people in the world dream about. How come they end up in a rehab center?  How come they are unhappy? Here's the how come: you see, for years, when they climb up the ranks, when they have the dream of becoming a famous person, a person who is admired, revered, a person who can get anything or anyone almost they want, when they dream about it, they may be unhappy. But they say themselves"OK. I'm unhappy now, but i will be happy when i get there". and then they get there, and they realize that there's no "there" there. They think it would make them happy, but it doesn't, and that's when the real problems begin, Because that's when they begin to experience helplessness. That's when they become resigned. That's when they go into-- **on the hamburger model, that's when they go into the learned helpessness, and resignation and the nihilism.** Because everyone has told them that once they make it then they'll be happy, and they told themselves"once i make it then i will be happy." and they are not any happier for it. Yeah, initially when the fame begins, and when they start having things in their way, as they always dream, of course they are happier. But then they go back to their base level. and when they go to their base level, they are suppressed, they are upset, they are disappointed, and more than anything, they are scared. Because what now? Until that point they were sustained by their hope that when they get there, they'll be happy, but they are not happier, and they are scared. and they are lost, and they look for solutions, very often outside of the normal experiences, outside of ordinary life. and where is that? That very often is with drugs and with alcohol, Because that takes us out of our normal day-to-day, ordinary lives. For good and ill. This misunderstanding prevalent and most people live that way. And they think-- and this is why so many people go through mid-life crisis for example, It's not the only reason. But it's one of the reasons. Because there are many people who are pretty accomplished, who have nailed it, and then they say" What now? Is this all the raise to it? " yes, this is all the raise to it. and the challenge is to identify the treasure of happiness that are embedded, that are there in the it and that are there all around us.(**目标是获得结果的手段**，这解释了为什么如此多的成功者不快乐，如此之多侧成功者沉沦于药品及酒精，他们常进心理治疗中心，那样进进出出，我们问“为什么会这样？”表面上看那些人似乎已得到一切，名声、财富、美人，他们想要的任何人，大部分人梦寐以求的生活，为什么他们最后还要进心理治疗中心？为什么会不开心？现在就来说说原因：多年来，他们不断努力向上，他们心怀梦想，希望成为名人，渴望得到别人的尊敬，渴望得到一切想要的东西或人，当他们梦想这些东西的时候，他们可能是不开心，但他们对自己说：“Ok, 我现在是不开心，但我成功后会很开心”，然后他们成功了，他们意识到并没有料想中的开心，他们以为那会让他们开心，但并没有，那时真正的问题才到来，因为到那时他们才开始体会到无助，那时他们就会放弃，**那时他们就会变得――根据Hamburger 的模型，他们会患上习得性无助，自我放弃和怀疑主义**，因为大家都跟他们说，他们实现了这事就会快乐，而他们也对自己说过“一旦实现了这件事，就会快乐。”但他们并不为此而更快乐，一开始，当刚开始有点名气，他们刚开始走上成功之路，他们常常梦想成功，当然就会快乐一点，但之后他们又回到基础水平，当回到基础水平，他们很压抑，很沮丧，很失望，更甚的是，他们很害怕，因为不知道怎么办好，但在那之前，他们以一种希望支撑着，想着成功后，他们会很快乐，但他们并没有更快乐，他们很害怕，很迷茫，他们想寻求解决方法，这样通常就会脱离正常经验，脱离常规生活，那有什么解决方法呢？常常就是样品和酒精，因为那让我们远离枯燥乏味的日常生活，无论是好的或坏的。这种错误的想法非常普遍，大部分人都如此，他们认为――这就是为什么，这么多人会经历中年危机，这不是唯一的原因，却是其中一个原因。因为有很多非常成功的人，他们成功后会说：“那现在这么办？这就是它带来的快乐吗？”是的，它就只能带来这么多快乐，而面临的难题是去找出埋藏起来的幸福宝藏，它就在我们身边。)
10. Tal:Happiness is not about making it to the peak of the mountain, nor is it about climbing aimlessly around the mountain; Happiness is the experience of climbing toward the peak." It's about having a goal, It is about having a destination in mind, and then letting go and enjoying the process. (Tal:幸福并不是登上山峰，也不是在山的四周没有方向的乱爬，幸福是向山峰攀登的过程，它与设定目标有关，与设定一个终点有关，然后就释放自己，享受过程。)
11. Gwendolyn Brooks:"Live not for battles won, Live not for the end of the song, Live for the along."(Gwendolyn Brooks:"不为胜利而活，不为曲终而活，为美好过程而活。")
12. It's such an important component of happiness is spirituality. the dictionary definition of spirituality is one of the definitions is the real sense of significance of something. So if i see something as significant, as important, as meaningful, I am having a spiritual experience engaging in it.(幸福的重要组成部分是精神性，字典对精神性的定义其中一个是：对有重大意义的事情的感知，因此如果我发现一些极具意义，极其重要的东西，意义非凡的，我就对它有种精神性体验。)
13. The thing to keep in mind is that it doesn't matter what i choose, what direction i go in, If i choose something that is self-concordant that is aligned with my personal goals and mission, I will lead a spirtitual life.(要记住，选择什么，往哪个方向走并不重要，如果我选择的东西是自我和谐的，和我个人的目标和使命相符合，我就会过上精神性生活。)
14. Becoming self-concordant is a difficult skill, requiring both accurate self-perceptual abilities, and the ability to resist social pressures that may sometimes push one in inappropriate directions.(实现自我和谐是非常困难的，要求精确的自我知觉能力，还有抵抗社会压力的能力，那种压力有时会把人迫往错误的方向。)
15. **Life is too short to do what i have to do, It's barely long enough to do what i want to do.** The sooner we start on the want-to, the better.(**人生短得完成不了我必须做的事，人生的长度仅够我完成想做的事，**越早开始我们想做的事越好。)
16 self-concordant(自我和谐)
	* Do it better with pleasure.(愉悦劳作则获多。)
	* There is a lot of research that shows that when we are engaged in a self-concordant goal, we are much more likely to then continue to pursue self-concordant goals, Because it was good that we were more successful; we want more of it , It's self-reinforcing.(有很多研究显示，当我们沉浸于自我和谐的目标时，就会更倾向于继续追求其他自我和谐的目标，因为这样很好，我们更成功了，我们还不满足，这叫自我强化。)

17. Values in action(VIA),
what are your personal character strength?(你的人格力量是什么？)：
* Is this the real me? do i feel authentic, most myself, when i am working on a group? when i am leading people? when i am learning something new? when i am praying? when i am watching a comedy or telling jokes or listening to jokes? when do i feel most myself? William james, back in the 19th century:"I have often thought the best way to define a man's character would be to seek out the particular mental or moral attitude in which, when it came up on him, he felt himself most deeply and intensely active and alive. at such moments there is a voice inside which speaks and says:'This is the real me!'"When is the real you coming out? Is it when you act bravely? Is it when you apply yourself and work hard at something? Is it when you plan-- and you are prudent careful about the future? (这是真的我吗？我是否觉得这真的是我自己，当我在团体里工作时？当我领导别人时？当我学新东西时？当我祈祷时？当我在看一部喜剧，或是讲笑话、听笑话时？我什么时候觉得最是我自己？十九世纪时，William James说：“我时常觉得定义一个人性格最好的办法就是寻找特定的心理，或道德态度，当它们出现时，他觉得自己最为积极和活跃，在这种时刻，他内心有一个声音在说：‘这就是真的我。’”你的真我在什么时候出现呢，是你表现英勇的时候吗？是你全身心投入，认真地做某事的时候吗？是你作为一个审慎的人，你的计划，很好地计划了未来的时候吗？)
two exercises:
* The first is about building capacity 
18. Wrzesniewski:people's perception of work can be classified into three categories.(Wrzesniewski：人们对于工作的概念可以分为三类：)
* The first one: people perceive their work as a job, their motivation is paycheck at the end of the month or the end of the week; work as something i hae to do-- It's a chore, i have no choice about it; what do they expect-- nothing much; they look forward to TGIF or the holiday, the break, the end of the semaster, the end of the two year period, or whatever it may be. （第一类，大部分人认为工作就是工作，他们的动力是每个月末，或者每个周末的工资，工作是我不得不做的事，它是琐事，我别无选择，他们期待什么呢？没有什么，他们期待星期五，期待放假休息，期待学习结束，期待两年研究生结束，或者之类的。）
* The second one: people perceive their work as a career, money and advancement are what motivates these individuals, getting to the next stage; work as-- it's a race, a race to the top, this is what the rat racers mostly reside; the expectation-- more prestige, more power, more money, more prestige, more power, again, advancement, attainment, achievement of the next goal; and the are looking forward to the next promotion.（第二类，有些人认为工作是职业，薪酬和晋升是他们的动力，不断地升值，工作就像赛跑，跑到最高处，这是好胜者常有的情况，他们的期望是更多的特权，更强的力量，更多的钱，更多的特权，更强的力量，晋升，升职，不断地成就，他们寄望的是不断的升职。）
* The third one : people perceive their work as a calling, primarily it doesn't mean that the person who perceives his or her work as a calling does not sometimes experience it as a job, However, overall, they perceive their work as a calling versus a career versus a job. the lucky few who perceive their work as calling , the motivation is the thing in itself, I t's about self-concordant goal, It's also about self-concordant journey; How do they perceive work-- It's a mission, it's a vocation, It's what they are meant to be doing, it's what they want to be doing more than anything else in the world, they see it not as a chore, but it's a privilege to be engaged in what it is that they are doing; their expectations-- their mission: a better world. and finally, what do they look forward to-- more work. more work where they can actualize themselves, where they can fulfill themselves, where they can be-- to use the military cliche-- all they can be. (第三类，少数人认为工作是一种使命,这并不意味着将工作视为使命的人就不会时不时觉得这只是工作，但总体而言，他们认为他们的工作是一种使命，而非职业或仅仅是工作。那些幸运地将工作视为使命的少数人，他们的动力来自于工作本身，是一种自我和谐的目标，是自我和谐的奋斗过程，他们怎么理解工作，他们认为这是种任务，是种使命，他们本就该做这个，做这件事比起所有其他事都更乐意，他们不认为这是琐事，能够参与其中，就是一种特权，他们的期望，也是他们的使命，是使世界更美好，而最后，他们寄望的是更多的工作，从而他们能够实现自身，成就自身，引用军事名言：可以成为任何他们想成为的人。)
19. Important thing also to keep in mind about calling is that well it does depend to some extent on the kind of work that you do. It depends much more on your perception of the work.(关于使命同样要记住的一点是，它确实从某种程度上取决于你工作的种类，但更取决于你对工作的理解。)
20. Abraham Maslow:"It is certainly true that many of us evade our constitutionally suggested vocations(call, destiny, task in life, mission).  So often we run away from the responsibilities dictated(or rather suggested) by nature, by fate, even sometimes by accident, just as jonah tried- in vain- to run away from his fate." Just listen to the voice that suggests your vocation, Just listen to the call that guides you to your calling. What is it? You know the problem is we don't take time to think about these questions. sometimes because we are afraid of the answer, Because what if it is teaching, You know, what about all the pressure that i feel from the outside to go and be a consultant? what about the pressure that i hear from my friends and colleagues who say"well you should do something else more 'noble' with your harvard education." The most noble thing is to listen to that inner voice, Because when we pursue our passions. when we pursue a self-concordant goal and a self-concodant journey, that's when we come alive. and that's when we also make the world a better place. Remember Gandhi:" Be the change you want to see in the world." And if you want a happier world, begin with yourself. (Abraham Maslow:"没错，我们许多人回避了我们天生的职业(使命、命运、天命、职责)，因此我们经常逃脱了一些本性，命运所指定(或者说暗示)的责任，即使有时是意外的，就像Jonah试图逃离他的命运，最终失败了一样" 听从暗示你天命的那个声音，听从指引你使命的召唤，它是什么？问题在于我们没有花时间来思考这些问题，有时候是因为我们害怕得到答案，因为万一你是想去教书呢？而所有来自外界的压力让你去做顾问怎么办？而来自朋友和同事的压力说：“你应该做点别的，用你的哈佛文凭去找更好的工作时的压力”，最好的工作就是听从你的内心，因为当我们追求自己热爱的事业时，当我们追求自我和谐的目标，和自我和谐的奋斗过程时，我们才能真正的活着，才能将世界变得更美好。记得甘地说过：“成为你希望看到的改变。”如果你想让世界更快乐，就要从自己做起。)
21. Ambani Carter:"Instead of focusing on what we can live with, We should be thinking about what we can't live without."(Ambani Carter:"我们不应该专注于生命中可以拥有的，而应该想到那些我们生命中不可或缺的。")
22. a few tips about setting goals:(制定目标的一些建议：)
* First, write them down. you know writing them down is making a commitment, much more of a commitment than just saying them even than just to say them just to ourselves or think about them. But writing them down makes a difference. a lot of research showing the effect of making plans, lists and writing goals.(首先，要把它们写下来，写下来就是做一种承诺，比起只是把它们说出来，最好是公开的把它们说出来，而不是只说给自己听，或者只是想想，但把它们写下来完全不同，很多研究都显示了制定计划、列出并写下目标的作用。)
* Second, set lifelines. you know people talk about deadlines, Tammy, my wife says:"I think it's much more effective, much more useful to set lifelines."Dates by which we hope to achieve those certain goals, Why lifelines? because goals, expecially self-concordant goals are about inspiring us. In other words, putting the spirit inside us. They are about making our life happier. more energetic.(其次，制定最早期限，很多人都会说“最后期限”，我的妻子Tammy说：“我觉得制定最早期限会更有效，更有帮助。”也就是我们希望完成这些目标的日期。为什么要制定最早期限呢，因为目标，尤其是自我和谐的目标是可以激励我们的，换句话说，给我们注入活力，它们使我们的生活更快乐，更具有活力，因此要制定最早期限。)
* third, make them specific. In other words, it's not i am going to improve salse pretty soon or very quickly, but rather  i am going to increase sales 5 percent by December 31, 2008. spicific lifeline as well as specific project. (最后，加上日期，使它们细化。换言之，不是说我马上，或者很快就会提升销量，而是我会在2008年12月31日前使销量增加5%。具体的最早期限，以及具体的目标。)
23. When people had goals and then did not achieve these goals, or achieve these goals and did not set new goals, they will feel enervated, and very often, uninspired. So stretch goals.(当人们有了目标而没有实现这些目标，或者实现了目标却没有制定新目标时，他们就会感到精疲力竭，失去动力。所以，要明确目标。)
# Lesson 13. face the presure.(面对压力)
1. The most important thing when dealing with stress is all about cognitive reframing. when dealing with stress, what we need to do is take time out.(当面临压力时最重要的事就是意识重建，我们要做的事就是抽出一些时间。)
2. The conventional question, the traditional psychologist question was "Why are so many people stressed?" An inportant question, good question, question that many great answers but not enough. and then positive psychologists came in. and what they did was ask also the positive question. Just like "What do those who were successful and able to lead a healthy and happy life do?" In other words, focusing on what works. In other words, focusing on tip of the stem. Because while most people are stressed, not all of them are. There are people who are able to be successful and at the same time, lead a health and happy life. what do they do? what is it about them? Here is what they do:what was found was that there are some distinguishing characteristics- two of them: first, they set rituals for themselves; the second thing they do- and this it what i am going to elaborate on now is in addition to having rituals, whether it's a lot of rituals or a few rituals, depending on individual needs and differences. **they particularly set rituals for both work and for recovery.** Let me explain, what i am going to say now is something that psychologists did not see before, because it was hidden just like the children on the bus or hidden by the first question. It was only after asking the second question that they notice this, **what they noticed was that these individuals ritualize work and recovery and in essence what they found- this is the most surprising result in my mind in study stress is that sress was actually not the problem, we were looking in the wrong place, In fact, what they found was stress was good for us! The stress actually cultivated resilience, strength and helped us be happier in the long run.** wait a minute, what does that mean? well, think about the following analogy, Think about the physical realm. what actually happens to you when you go to the gym? when you go to the gym, you lift weights, what are you doing to your muscle? You are stressing your muscle! In fact, you are carrying part of the- there
are micro tears in your cells. Now is this a bad thing? That you are doing that? Not at all! It's a good thing. Because you lift weights and then two days later, you lift these weights again. And the next week, you continue lifting these weights, and on and on, you do it for a month and two and four months and six months, and after a year of lifting weights, you begin to look like me! or maybe not, So the stress part is actually good for us. what's the problem though? when do the problems begin with stressing those muscles? It's when you lift weights, and a minute later, you lift the same weights again, and again, and again, and again, and so on and so on. what would happen to you then, if you don't take a break, whether it's a break between sessions, whether it's break, days break? what happens to you then? That's when you get injured. That's when you get hurt. That's when you actually tear or pull a muscle, That's when you become over worked, and that has psychological as well as physical effects. That's when you are over trained. **In other words, the problem is not stress, not on the physical level, nor on the psychological level, The problem is lack of recovery.** Individuals who are both successful, happy, thriving, flourishing are ones who do experience stress. However, they also pay very close attention to recovery. Just like any athlete here in this room knows that you have tapering, you have time-off before important games. you don't lift the same weights day in and day out. The same thing on the psychological level, if we don't take breaks, we will pay a price- on the physical level, we get injured; on the psychological level, we experience anxiety, ultimately, potentially depression. **stress is fine, It's good, It's exciting at times, if we also have recovery.**(传统的问题，传统的心理学家会问：“为什么这么多人压力过大？”这是非常重要的，非常好的问题，能够引出很多好的回答，但仍然不够，然后积极心理学出现了，而他们所做的是，同样问一些积极的问题，就像“那些成功的、过着健康快乐生活的人是怎么做的？”换句话说，关注起作用的事物，也就是关注尖端的芽，因为虽然很多人都压力过大，但不是所有人都这样，有一些人能够很成功，同时过着健康和快乐的生活，他们是怎么做的？他们做了些什么？他们是这样做的：人们发现，他们有一些特别的特质，有两点：第一，他们为自己建立例行公事；第二件事，也就是我现在要详细讲的，除了建立例行公事，不管是很多的例行公事，还是寥寥几件，视乎个人需要和个人差异，**除了建立例行公事，他们还特别地不仅为工作，还为恢复也建立了例行公事。**让我来解释下，我现在要说的是心理学家以前没有意识到的，因为它就像公车上的孩子一样隐藏，或者被第一个问题掩盖着，只有问了第二个问题，他们才会注意到，**他们注意到这些人将工作和恢复例行公事化，本质上他们发现的是，这是我觉得研究压力时所得的最惊人的结果，那就是问题其实不在于压力，我们找错了地方，事实上他们发现压力对我们是有好处的，压力实际上培养了我们的忍耐性、力量，并且从长远来讲让我们更快乐。**稍等片刻，这是什么意思呢？想想下面这个类比，想想运动方面，你去健身房时实际上发生了什么呢？当你去健身房，你举重时，你对你的肌肉做了什么？你在给你的肌肉压力！事实上，你其实就在... 你的细胞在偷偷流泪，请问这是坏事吗？你所做的事是坏事吗？完全不是，这是件好事，因为你举重，然后两天之后，再去举重，然后下周，你接着举重，长此以往，你举了一个月、两个月、四个、六个月，然后举了一年的重之后，你就会像我一样，或者也不会，所以压力其实对我们是有好处的，那真正的问题是什么？比如说压缩肌肉时，问题是从什么时候开始的呢？是你去举重，然后一分钟之后，你又去举重，然后不断举，不断举，不断不断地举，然后会发生的事就是，如果你不休息，不管是运动之间的休息，或者是休息几天，那么会发生什么呢？你就会受伤，那时你就会受伤，你的肌肉就会拉伤，那时你就会锻炼过度，这既是生理上的，也有心理上的影响，这时候你就是锻炼过度了。**换言之，问题不在于压力，不是生理上的问题，也不是心理上的问题，问题在于缺少恢复。**那些即成功有快乐幸福的人是会感受到压力的，然而他们很注重恢复，就好像在座的任何运动员都知道，你们会有调整期，在重要比赛前都会有休息，你们不会每天去举重，从心理层面上讲也是这样，如果我们不懂得休息，我们会付出代价，在生理层面上，我们会受伤，在心理层面上，我们会感到焦虑，最终可能导致抑郁。**压力没有关系，它是好事，如果我们能恢复，它有时甚至是很令人兴奋的。**)
3. Tony Schwartz and Jim Loehr: **what we need to do is change our perception of our day, from being marathon runners to being sprinters, from going on and on and on, to sprinting, recovery, sprinting, recovery.** That understanding changed my life, I was a marathon runner, metaphorically- meaning at work, I used to work 14 hours a day, I loved my work, I worked extremely hard. and then i decided to get married and to have children, and i knew that things would change as a result of that, and i said:"OK, i have to compromise. i have to work less than 14 hours a day if i want to maintain a healthy relationship with my spouse and with my kids."and it disappointed me to some extent, but i have my priorities. and i made a choice. and then i met Tony Schwartz, who within a few minutes changed my perception, my understanding of what my day can and ought to look like. and when he explained to me this, it made immediate sense. I Started to implement it, and today i may not be as productive as i was when i worked for 14 hours a day, but very close to it. And i am certainly happier. and i am more creative than i was when i was a marathoner. and **here is his suggestion: One of the things that he talks about in the book, this is a ritual that i recommend and it is:have 60 to 120 minutes, so around 90 minutes, of sprint, work, concentrate, focus hard, go for it. and then after that, after you sprint, with as little distraction as possible, have 15 minutes or so of recovery.** what psychologist found is essentially we are able to sprint, to focus, according to our bio-rhythms between 60 and 120 minutes- it differs. some people are more 60; others can do it for two hours, Average: 90 minutes, After you sprint, take 15 minutes off, whether it's for meditation, listening to your favorite piece of music, whether it's for going to the gym, having lunch, having a break- and during lunch, not doing emails and being on the phone, which only adds to the stress, really relaxing with friends or by ourselves, and when we have a day that tructured with sprint, recovery, sprint, recovery, that's when we can sustain, when we have a higher levels of energy, when we get the most done and when we are happiest. this is my day now. my day comprises sprint, recovery, sprint, recovery. I'm able to get so much more done, my ideal day, work day is 90 minutes, 15minutes meditation; 90 minutes, lunch; 90 minutes, work out; 90 minutes, home with family. Actually net- i work for 6 hours a day, But in those 6 hours, I get more than i would have in 10- not to mention the fact that i am happier and more creative doing it. **The key when doing it is to maintain flexibility**, Because the ideal day for me would be that, However, there are other things you know- i travel a lot, i teach a class, during those times, let's say i am not by my computer, writing or doing research- again, because these are important things to me. so what would i have done for example is say i want ten 90 minutes sessions, the ritual of ten 90 minutes session a week. some of these 90 minutes sessions are on a flight and that's ok, some of these 90 minutes sessions are at home or in my office. But at lease ten, usually more than ten 90 minutes sessions a week. And when i have it, i am happy, i feel good. i get a lot done. also, the ritual of yoga, maintain flexibility there, so one of the things that are difficult for me is to introduce a 45 minutes or one hour session a day, and yoga is important for me, so what i started to do was breaking down yoga sessions and  now part of my 15 minutes in between is 15 minute yoga, sunset, and then the next 15 minutes is another part of yoga practice. so i break yoga into two or three sessions a day instead of one. **Again, the flexibility of ritual.** **the key is to attain multi-level recovery. First recovery: on the micro level, 15 minutes meditation, one hour of gym, whatever it is, a lunch break. Middle: mezo level recovery and that is a good night sleep, sleep is important, a day off during the week. Even God needed a day off. Implemented in our lives. and finally, those vacations. Remember J.P.Morgan:"I can do the work of a year in 0 months, but not in 12." Recreation leads to creation.** and that for me works. works very well.(Tony Schwartz and Jim Loehr:"**我们所要做的是将我们对生活的理解从马拉松运动员变为短跑运动员，从不停地跑、跑、跑，变为短跑――恢复――短跑――恢复。"**这个想法改变了我的人生，我曾经是个马拉松运动员，我是指在工作上，我每天工作14小时，我热爱我的工作，非常努力，然后我决定结婚生子，我知道因此可能一切会变得不一样，然后我说：“好吧，我必须妥协，我只能一天工作少于14小时，如果我想和我的妻子以及孩子保持良好的关系的话。”某种程度上有点失望，但我有我优先的考虑，我做了这样的决定，然后我遇到了Tony Schwartz,他只用了几分钟就改变了我的观念，改变了我对我的人生应该是怎么样的理解，当他跟我说时，我立即意识到就应该是这样的，我开始运用它，而今天我可能没有一天工作14小时，那么有效率，但也十分接近了，而我显然更快乐了，我比还是个“马拉松运动员”时更有创造力。**他的建议是这样的：他在书里讲到这样一个东西，这是我推荐的一种习惯，用一到两个小时，也就是大约一个半小时来“短跑”专注地工作，精力非常集中，然后在那之后，“短跑”之后，在尽可能少分心的情况下，用十五分钟来恢复。**心理学家发现我们能够“短跑”，能够专注，按照我们的生物钟，能持续一到两个小时，每个人可能不同，有些人是一个小时，有些人可以持续两个小时，平均是一个半小时，“短跑”之后，休息十五分钟，可以是冥想，听你最喜欢的音乐，也可以是去健身，吃午饭，休息一下，但在午饭时，不收邮件，不接电话，那些只会增加焦虑，而是和朋友一起或独自完全放松，如果我们的一天是短跑――恢复――短跑――恢复，我们就能持续，能够维持高水平的精力，做更多的工作，并且更快乐。我现在的生活就是如此，我的一天就是短跑――恢复――短跑――恢复，我能做更多的工作，我理想的一天就是一个半小时的工作，十五分钟冥想；一个半小时，午餐；一个半小时，运动；一个半小时，回家和家人在一起；我一天净工作6个小时，但在这6个小时中，我能做比十个小时还多的事，更不用说我更快乐，并且更有创造性了。**这样的关键在于维持灵活性。**因为--对我来说理想的一天是这样的，然而总是有一些别的事，比如我经常出差，我要教课，在这种时候，我不在电脑旁，我要是个一个半小时的时间段，例行的每周是个一个半小时时间段，有一些这种时间段是在飞机上，这没关系，有一些时间段我在家里或者在办公室里，但每周至少要有十个，通常多于十个一个半小时的时间段，当我做到时，我很快乐，我感觉很好，我做了很多事。又比如瑜伽的习惯，维持灵活性，对我来说很困难的一件事就是每天留出45分钟或者一个小时的时间段，但瑜伽对我很重要，它使我感觉良好，所以我所做的是，拆分瑜伽的时间段，现在那15分钟的间隔有时是15分钟的瑜伽，15分钟的日落瑜伽，然后下一个15分钟做另一种瑜伽练习，所以我将瑜伽拆分成每天两到三个时间段，**又是例行公事的灵活性。**这对我来说有用，非常有效。**关键在于保证不同程度的恢复，第一种恢复：从最小的级别，15分钟的冥想，1小时健身，或者是午餐休息，随便什么；中间级别的恢复：就是睡一个好觉，我们会讲到睡觉的重要性，睡眠是对幸福、对快乐、对创造力，以及对你的记忆力的重要投资。睡眠很重要，每周都要休息一天，即使上帝也需要一天的休息，我们的生活也是这样；最后：就是假期，J.P.Morgan说过：“我可以一年工作9个月，但不能工作12个月。”** **娱乐带来创造力**，记住这点。)

# Lesson 14. Too much of a good thing.(过犹不及)
1. Too much of a good thing. Quantity dose affect quality. The key is focus.(过犹不及，多则劣，少则精。专注是关键。)
2. The Hendricks couple(Susan & Clyde Hendrick): "Love and sex are affected negatively by stress. If we can help people to simplify their lives, thus reducing their stress levels, it is very likely that people's relationships would be enriched greatly. More over, the positive aspects of their lives would be enriched accordingly."(Hendrick 夫妇说过：“爱和性与压力成反比，如果我们能帮助人们简化生活，降低压力水平，那他们的关系将会大大改善，更重要的是，他么你生活中的积极方面，也会相应得到提升。”)
3. A research: When you have your email on while you are doing work that requires concentration, It is equivalent to taking off 10 IQ points. for comparison's sake, if you lose a whole night sleep, if you haven't slept for 36 hours, you IQ is reduced by the wquivalent of 10 points. Another point of comparison: if you smoke marijuana, if you smoke grass, your IQ's reduced by 4 points. so if you have- look i mean it's the choice- more fun, less IQ points, well but don't inhale.(一项研究：当你开着邮箱，从事需要集中注意的工作时，等于智商减少10分，整整10分。作为比较，如果你一整晚通宵，36小时不睡，也等于智商减少10点。另一项比较，如果你抽大麻，智商会减少4，所以如果你...面临选择，是要找乐子，还是降低智商，但千万别吸毒。)
4. Tim kasser:"Meterial affluence matters very little to our well being, beyond having our basic needs met, hardly even affects our well being. however, what does affect our well being is what kasser calls 'time affluence', which is the feeling that we have time, the feeling that we can savor the things that we are doing, that we are not constantly chasing our own shadow, that we are not constantly running around and feeling stressed. and people who have time affluence in their lives that is a good predictor of well being."(Tim kasser:"物质充裕对于我们的幸福感影响不大，基本需求得到满足之外，几乎不会影响我们的幸福感，但是，的确会影响我们幸福感的是Kasser所说的'时间充裕'，这是一种感觉，我们感到时间充裕，感到我们能充分享受手头所做的事，而不是竹篮打水，做无用功，东奔西跑，压力巨大。时间充裕的人，往往容易获得幸福感。")
5. One of the shortest- or the shortest word in the English language and yet people are so afraid of it, saying "No", whether it's saying no to people who ask you something, again saying no empathically, or saying no to opportunities, Because essentially when we are saying no to some opportunities, when we are saying no to some offers, we are saying yes to ourselves. and how do we choose what do we say no to and what do we say yes to? By simply asking what do i really, really, really want to do. simplifying- doing less, rather than more. **The key though is to reach optimum levels of simplicity.** Because we don't want to simplify too much, and go to the other extreme. the relationship between amount of work and productivity, creativity and happiness is a parabola, meaning if our amount of work is too high, that's when we experience the TBD, Too Busy Disorder. We are unhappy; we are not creative; and we are not productive. This is the burn-out. we may be productive and creative for a short while. On the other hand, if we do too little, that's also not good, and very similar consequences- we are unhappy; we are certainly not productive, and we are not creative. this is textreme procrastination(the left), this is over work(the right),what we want to find is our optimum, for each person, this is in a different place。 (英语语言中最短的，但又人人害怕的单词是：“NO”，无论是对寻求帮助的人说“不”，还是对眼前的机遇说“不”，因为我们队某些机遇说“不”，对某些提议说“不”时，其实是对自己说“是”，那如何选择对什么说“不”，对什么说“是”呢？很简单，问自己究竟想要什么。简化，宁缺毋滥。**关键就是找到最适宜的简化程度**，因为过于简化，就会走向另一个极端，工作量与效率、创造力和快乐额之间的关系是下抛物线形式，意味着如果工作量太大，就会发生TBD，即忙碌紊乱症，我们会不快乐、缺乏创造力、效率低下，这里（靠右）是精疲力竭点，也许短时间能维持效率和创造力一段时间，另一方面，如果我们什么也不做，那也不好，后果相似，我们会不快乐，没有效率，缺乏创新，这点（靠左）代表极端拖延，这点（靠右）代表过度工作，我们要发掘各自的最适宜点，每个人都不一样。)
6. The law of gas:Even if we have very little work, it will take up all of our time. and (气体再少也能充满整个空间，工作再少也会占用我们所有时间。关键就是找到最适宜的简化程度。)
7. **sustainalbe**:what we are talking about when we are talking about sustainalbe growth is that we take out of ourselves, we exert, we stress ourselves and replenish through recovery just enough, so that it is sustainalbe. Because if we don't replenish, then it's not sustainalbe. and then we begin to experience anxiety, depression, burn-out and so on. (**可持续增长**：我们提倡的可持续增长是指我们努力奋斗，竭尽全力，给予自己一定压力，然后通过充分的休整得以恢复，这才是可持续。因为如果不恢复，那就无法持续，就会出现焦虑、抑郁、疲惫等情绪。)

## Lesson 14. Procrastination(拖延症)
1. Now procrastination is associated with lower levels of happiness, weakened physical immune system, high levels of stress and could also lead to depression.(拖延症与不快乐、生理免疫系统脆弱、压力过大等等都有关联，可能会导致抑郁。)
2. The reseach is done at the University of Carleton in Canada where they have an actual procrastination reseach group. Here some of the important results for overcoming procrastination. First, most important one, simple, easy to implement and it works, It's what they call "The 5 minute take-off". **one of the things they found with, just about all procrastinators is that they have a misunderstanding of what it takes to act. Procrastinators, the world over, think that in order to act, they first need to be inspired.** I have to feel the vibes, before i start the EC 10 problem set. I really have to be inspired before i write this paper for Lit and Arts. But you know what? That's not how it works, It's not about first changing our attitude,i.e. becoming inspired and then acting. **It usually works the other way around. we first need to start acting, behavior that will then affect our attitude. Because very often once we start, we are on a roll,** or sometimes, a few times, during let's say the 90 minutes sprint, we have to restart the 5 minute. I don't know if you have moticed this, I am extremely, extremely passionate about positive psychology. I love positive psychology. But you know, sometimes when i get up in the morning, and i write something about positive psychology or prepare a lecture on positive psychology, or read positive psychology, sometimes i don't feel like starting. this is actually a very big surprise for my wife.Yes, exactly! Because i know the 5 minute take-off, and sometimes within a 90 minute session, I have to do another 5 minute take-off, because my energy levels are drained. so either take time off to recover, or if i think that is just procrastination, **I say it's OK. for 5 minutes, just push. and very often 5 minutes start an upward spiral. not through the mind, Not through the heart, Through action.** **The 5 minute take-off probably the most useful technique for overcoming procrastination. Just do it-- in other words.**(加拿大卡尔顿大学拖延症心理研究小组的研究：如何克服拖延？首先，最重要的一点，很简单，容易实践且有效，他们称之为“5分钟起步”，**他们发现所有拖延者都有一个共同点：他们对行动的要求有所误解，全世界的拖延者都以为，要有所行动，必须先受到激励。**我必须感受到共鸣，才能开始编写经济学10号课程的题库。我必须有所灵感，才能下笔写文学艺术论文。但事实并不是这样，**第一步并不是改变态度，即受到激励，然后行动。恰恰相反，要先开始行动，行动会慢慢地影响我们的态度，因为通常行动开始后，我们会有惯性。**或者有时候，比如在90分钟冲刺中，我们需要重新5分钟起步。我不知道你们有没有注意到，我非常非常热衷积极心理学，我喜欢积极心理学，但有时候，我早上起床，写关于积极心理学的文章，准备积极心理学讲座，或者阅读积极心理学文章，有时候我完全不在状态，这让我太太大吃一惊，是的，没错，因为我了解5分钟起步，有时候在90分钟时间段里，我不得不再做一次5分钟起步，因为我感到精力不支，所以要么花时间休整，要么我只是有拖延情绪。**我说没事，就5分钟，坚持住就行。这5分钟往往会让我产生一个向上的螺旋，不是通过思想，不是通过心灵，而是通过行动。** **5分钟起步可能是克服拖延最有用的技巧了，换句话说，就是放手去做。**)
3. Rewards are certainly legit and important.(奖励当然很重要。)
4. Go public, Throw your knapsack over the wall, Tell people what you are going to achieve, Because i went public with it, i threw my knapsack over the wall,  and i had to start working, whether i liked it or not, and that helped me overcome procrastination, because i knew that i wanted to teach at some point. But when i went public with it, In a sense, it "forced" me to do it.(公布出去，破釜沉舟，告诉大家你的目标。因为我公布了目标，破釜沉舟，不得不着手开工，无论我是否喜欢，这帮助我克服了拖延，因为我知道自己想开设专题讨论会,一旦对外公布，某种意义上，我就被迫去做了。)
5. The best predictor, for example of maintaining an exercise regime is doing it with other people. Now this is not right of everyone, some people exercise is something that they want to do by themselves, and that's OK, However, for most people, doing with other people actually helps. It also helps to write down-- this is a commitment,  write down goals. Divide and conquer, Break down the achievement, Remember Langer's research? Write these things down, Make a list. It actually helps most people. And finally, permission to recreate. what that means is give yourself permission to be human; give yourself permission to procrastinate at times as well; give yourself permission to recover. you are not a machine, we are not machines. we need to understand the constraint of you of nature. Because if we don't understand it, if we don't respect nature, nature is not going to respect us, and we are going to pay a price, in terms of our productivity, our creativity as well as our happiness-- the ultimate currency.(最好的预言者，比如坚持训练课程的方法之一就是和其他人一起进行，注意，这可能不是每个人都适用，有些人喜欢一个人进行训练，这也完全没问题，但是对大多数人来说，与别人一起进行会有所帮助。书面写下也很有用――这等于建立了契约，把目标写下来，分阶段进行，各个击破，还记得Langer的研究吗？把目标写下来，列一张表，对大多数人来说很有用。最后一点，允许自己娱乐消遣；准许自己为人；有时候拖延一下也未尝不可；允许自己休整；你不是机器，我们都不是机器，我们需要了解能力的范畴，否则就是违背自然，自然就会报复我们，让我们付出代价，效率降低，失去创造力与幸福感，也就是我们的终极货币（幸福感）。)

# Lesson 15. Perfectionism(完美主义)
1. Elbert Hubbard:"The greatest mistake a man can make is to be afraid of making one."(Elbert Hubbard:"一个人能犯的最大错误就是害怕犯错。")
2. George Eliot:"The important work of moving the world forward does not wait to be done by perfect men."(George Eliot:“推动世界前进的重任并不是由完人来进行的。”)
3. Psychological safety:Psychological safety is the feeling, the experience, the space that you feel in your workplace, in your organization, where you are safe talking about errors and mistakes, where you feel safe falling down and getting up again. and these organizations with their own psychological safety, they performed better. Organizations with their psychological safety, with theri employees don't or are not afraid of whistle blowing, or not afraid of falling down of making mistakes, these organizations are significantly more successful. these are learning organizations. with the employees constantly learn and grow, or you learn from your mistakes, and then the next time you are able to do better. very significant, very important research,  whether it's for leaders, whether it's for parents-- would you have this psychological safety for your kids while they feel comfortable talking to you about things that they did not do well, about failures. **because if they do feel comfortable, they are much less likely to enter into this perfectionistic fear of failure, and they are much more likely to be happier as well as successful.**(心理安全概念：心理安全是一种感觉、经历、空间，让你感觉可以在办公室地点，在组织内安全地讨论错误与过失，让你觉得摔倒了也能安全地站起来。有心理安全的组织会表现地更好，证明了有心理安全的团队组织，他们的雇员不会害怕告密，也不会害怕摔倒、犯错，这些组织更为成功，它们是学习型组织，雇员不断地学习成长，从错误中学习，下一次就能做的更好。意义重大，影响深远的研究，无论是对领导者，还是家长――你们会不会为自己的孩子营造心理安全，让他们毫无约束地告诉你他们做的不好、失败的事，**因为如果他们愿意跟你说，他们就不容易进入害怕失败的完美主义，而会更快乐，更成功。**)
4. Thomas said:"Fire you? Fire you? I've just invested a million dollars in your education, and i am going to fire you?" "but just one more thing, if you make the same mistake again, I'm going to fire you."(Thomas 说到"解雇你？ 解雇你？我刚为你的教育投入了一百万美元，现在我要炒了你？" "还有一件事，如果你再犯同样的错误，我会炒了你。")
5. If you want to increase your success rate, double your failure rate.(如果你想提高成功率，就要将失败率翻倍。)
6. Jane Klam's reseach: what she found was the most successful people, people who have been able to persist are people who have failed on average 5 times before, so they have been on 5 diets and haven't succeeded, The fifth one, or the sixth one I am successful and i am able to sustain it, the same with the exercise regime. learn to fail or fail to learn.(Jane Klam 的研究：她发现最成功的、有毅力坚持下来的人，都平均经历过5次失败，也就是说他们减肥5次都没有成功，到了第五次、或者第六次才能成功并维持住的，运动也是如此。学会失败，从失败中学习。)
7. define of perfectionism: An **incapacitating fear** of failure that permeates our lives, especially those areas that we care about most. Note the world incapacitating, It's not just a fear of failure, OK I don't know a person who is not afraid of failure, who is not embarrassed by it or feels frustrated by it. so that's natural, That's human-- whether we like it or not. but an incapacitating fear of failure is the failure that is debilitating us , that stops us, that prevents us from coping, from trying, from putting ourselves on the line.  And the other part that **i want to highlight in this definition is that "especially those areas that we care about most."** (完美主义的定义：一种充斥在我们生活中的对失败的**失能性恐惧**，尤其是在我们最在意的方面。注意“失能性”这个词，不只是对失败的恐惧，好吧，我也不认识哪怕一个不害怕失败，也不会因为失败感到尴尬或沮丧的人。这是很自然的，这就是人性，不管我们喜欢不喜欢。但对失败的失能性畏惧是一种让我们在面对问题的时候裹足不前的畏惧，)
8. In that person who si on the excellence side, may be as ambitious, may have the same goals, may reach the same goals, **However, that person also enjoys the journey, That is the difference.** so yes, he or she gets into a top school, and at school they work extremely hard, However, they also learn it that they are able to, mostly, there is no 100 percent here- but mostly, enjoy their time in school, with the same ups and downs, the vicissitudes-natural-but enjoy school, and then get into the job they really wanted or one of the job they wanted, and work extremely hard there, and be ambitious, and work the 80 hour weeks, However, **that person also overall enjoys the journey, and then they enjoy the next setp and being associate, being a partner, and being the MD or whatever it is. The only difference is that they enjoy the journey.**(区别在于这个追求卓越的人(与追求完美的人)也许同样充满雄心壮志，有同样的目标，也可能达到了同样的目标，**然而这个人同时享受这个旅程，这就是区别所在。**是的，他或她会进入名校，在学校里他们非常勤奋刻苦，但同时他们也知道，他们几乎可以――不是完全，但几乎可以，享受他们在学校的所有时光，同样的起伏坎坷，同样的兴衰变迁，但他们享受这个过程，然后获得他们想要的工作，或者他们想要的工作之一，然后继续努力工作，充满雄心壮志，每周工作80个小时，**然而这个人同样享受整个过程，然后他们享受下一个旅途，和别人合作，成为别人的搭档，当上营销总监之类的，唯一的区别就在于他们享受这个过程。**)
9. How to overcome perfectionism?(如何克服完美主义？)
* The first one is being aware of it, being aware of what i want to change, and what i want to maintain.(首先是认识它，认识到我想改变什么，我想保持什么。)
* **Active acceptance**, It will always be part of us. After we accept it, we go ahead and change it. and we go ahead and change it by introducing behavior. **The key issue here is behavior.** one of the things that i did as i told you last time was **started to solicit feedback from people, started to solicit criticism.** Initially, literally i need to catch myself from responding, from attacking back. why? because criticism is the deviation from a straight narrow, from that schema, but over time i got used to it, it actually helped me. and now i am much open to criticism. still, sometimes catch myself when i want to respond and attack back. But overall, i got better through behavior changing attitude. something else- putting myself on the line more. (**主动地去接受**，它将永远是我们的一部分。在接受它之后，我们就去改变它，我们要通过建立行为来改变它。**这里的关键是行为。**我上节课讲过的一件我做过的事，**就是向别人寻求反馈，寻求批评，一开始我要控制自己不去回答，不去顶嘴反驳，**为什么？因为批评是对直线箭头的偏离，偏离那个基模，但我渐渐习惯了，这真的帮到了我，我现在更能包容批评。然而，我有时仍会想回答，想顶嘴反驳，但总体来说，我通过改变态度的行为变得更好。还有一点，使自己更经常处于水平线上。)
* Next, we don't always havae to act out in the world; we can also act in our internal simulator- The mind doesn't know the difference between the real thing and the imaginary thing. and therefore, i can imagine myself, see myself, acting as a person committed to excellence. so for example, before teaching, one of the things that i visualize is seeing myself there on the stage, feeling light, calm and accepting- in other words, a way that a person committed to excellence would, as opposed to a perfectionist would be constantly afraid of failure. and the mind doesn't know the difference. and the mind looks for consistency. and therefore, i am able to be that way. or much more likely to be that way, because of the visualization.(下一步，我们不一定要外在地表现出行为，我们也可以在内心中模拟，你的思想无法分辨现实和想象的区别的，因此我可以想象自己，幻想自己，就像一个追求卓越的人一样。比如说我在上课之前，我想象的一件事情就是假想我自己站在台上，感觉很轻松、冷静、并且很包容，换句话说，想象追求卓越的人会用的方式，二非总是害怕失败的完美主义者。你的大脑是不会知道有什么区别的，你的大脑需要一致性，因此我就能那样去做，或者更容易那样去做，因为我先幻想了。)
10. Coleridge:“well, at the end of my life, I will write my magnum opus, until then, everything is rough draft.”(Coleridge:“在我生命的结尾，我会写出我的巨著，在那之前，一切都只是草稿。"(从完美主义中解放))
11. How to help other?(怎么帮助别人？)
The first thing that is important to make very clear is that it is extremely difficult to help other people to deal with perfectionism, It mostly has to come from within. They have to want a change, because it takes time, Doesn't happen over night.(首先要搞清楚的一件重要的事就是帮助别人是非常困难的，处理完美主义的问题，通常都要从内部着手，他们必须要渴望改变，因为这是需要时间的，不是立竿见影的。)
* **The first most important thing to do is by example**, if i can change and become more a person committed to excellence, enjoy the journey, celebrate even failures, even falling down once in a while, Then i am leading by example, remember that people do what you do, rather than what you say;(首先最重要的事就是**树立榜样**，如果我能改变，成为一个追求卓越的人，享受过程，即使失败了也要庆祝，即使偶尔挫折也要庆祝，那我就做出了榜样，记着，人们更愿意照着你所做的去做，而不是你说的话。)
* The second thing to do is to tell stories about it, telling stories, sharing.(telling is one way street, sharing is both of us get.)(第二件事就是分享自己从完美主义者转变为追求卓越者这个故事，(再次强调，讲和分享的区别，分享：两者皆有收获，讲：只是单行道))
* Rewarding effort, Rewarding the journey.(奖励努力，奖励过程。)
12. Psychological maturity:Psychological maturity is about the ability to willingly shift perspective. It's the ability when we want to be immersed in the here and now, in the present, and it's the ability to , when we want, take a step back, zoom out both in time and in space, and ask the question:"Is this really going to matter? or in a year? or in a grand schema of things, space? Is this really important?" and at the same time, go back almost at will. Have this flexibility to go back. and be immersed when listening to a beautiful piece of music, or spending time with people we love. and again, it's easier said than done, But over time, we can train our mind through meditation, through cognitively reframing things. we can train our mind to be able to make that shift almost at will. (心理成熟：心理成熟就是根据**自己的意愿**转换角度的能力。就是我们希望沉浸在当下的一种能力。也正是我们退一步，时间和空间上都退一步，问这样的问题：“它真的有影响吗？一年之后呢？或者更长远来看呢？它真的很重要吗？”同时随心所欲地回来，能够灵活地将思绪拉回来，沉浸于聆听一首美妙的歌，或者和我们所爱的人一起。再次的，说起来容易，做起来难，但逐渐我们可以通过冥想来逐渐训练我们的思想，通过对事物进行认知重建，我们可以训练我们的思想，使其能够按照我们的意愿来转换。))
# Lesson 17. Sports and meditation(运动和冥想)
1. The wonder drug:(灵药配方)
* 30 minutes of physical exercise, 4 times a week.(30分钟的体育锻炼，每周4次。)
* at least 15 minutes of mindful exercise 6 or 7 times a week.(至少15分钟的意念锻炼，每周六到七次。)
8 hours of sleep more or less per 24 hours.(每24小时睡8小时。)
* 12 hugs a day.(每天12个拥抱。)
2. **It's not that exercising is like taking an antidepressant, It's rather that not exercising is like taking a depressant.** This is more than just a semantic difference. Why? Because you see, we weren't made to be sedentary. we weren't made to sit in front of the computer or in the classroom. we were made to run after that deer or run away from that lion, and we frustrate a need, as we have talked about earlier, we frustrate a need, we pay a price. So let's say our God-given or genes-given level of happiness, our base level of happiness is here, our set point or set range is here, when we don't exercise, what we are doing is that we are lowering that base level to here, and then whereas we could have lived our life up here with all the vicissitudes, and hopefully upward spiral, what we are doing is we are living our lives the same ups and downs- only a much lower level here, and we struggle just to get to our God-given or genes-given level of happiness. **不是锻炼就像服用抗抑郁药，而是不锻炼就像服用抗抑郁药，** 这不仅仅是语言上的区别，为什么？因为我们不是生来为了坐着的，我们不适合长时间坐在电脑前或教室里，我们本来应该去逐鹿，或者逃离狮子的追捕，而当我们无法满足这种需求时，正如之前讲的，我们无法满足需求，就要付出代价。比方说上帝或者基因决定的幸福程度，基本的幸福程度有这么高，我们固有的水平就这么高，如果我们不锻炼，我们就把这个基本水平降低到这里，然而我们是可以达到这样的幸福程度的（固有），即使有兴衰变迁，也可能是螺旋式上升的，而我们现在是经历了同样的起伏，只不过是在更低的水平上。我们努力挣扎着到达上帝决定或基因决定的幸福程度。)
## Sports（运动）
1. The barriers in keepping exercises four times a week:(保持一周四次运动习惯的障碍：)
* it's difficult there are some pain associated with it, even if you are at 70 percent of your heart rate. It's still uncomfortable. And ways to deal with it is at least as you get into it, cause very often we enter the zone when we start to run, we don't feel the difficulty any more.（伴随运动而来的疼痛 使运动更难了，即使你只达到最大心率的70%。运动引起不适，克服不适的最简单方法就是进入状态，因为通常我们跑步进入一种状态后，我们就感受不到不适了。）

* Another barrier- and this one is, unfortunately very common here on campus, is just we don't have time. I do give a lot of talks in high schools,and one of the things that I see there is that students generally, in many high schools actually have to be part of a team. They have to,in addition to doing physical exercise, PE, they also have to be part of a team. So they get not enough,but more exercise, whereas one of the first things that go in college, especially or only for students who do not play on the team, **one of the first things that go is exercise.** I don't have time.I have so many things that I want to do. It's a new world. Well,it's also the first things that goes during exam period, because I'm so stressed. I have so many things to do. Well,it should be the last thing to go. It should be the last thing to go. **Why? Because it is an investment.** You may be losing the 45 minutes. You know, working out for 30 minutes and showering after which I recommend. You may lose that 45 minutes. But you'll gain so much more.It's such a good investment. **Why? Because your memory actually gets better when you exercise. So you'll get more buck for the bank in terms of time you study; your creativity levels go up; your concentration, whether you have ADD or not,especially if you have or you have a tendency toward ADD or ADHD, but even for people without it, concentration goes up significantly. Energy levels go up significantly.So it's a very good investment.**（我经常去高中演讲，我注意到的其中一件事是 通常，很多高中要求学生参加团队活动，他们除了体育课做运动以外，还要参加团队活动，所以他们运动得更多 虽然还是不够，但是我们读大学第一件放弃的事，尤其是那些不参加团队活动的学生，**我们放弃的第一件事是运动。**我没有时间 我有很多事要做，大学是一个新世界，在考试期间 大家也首先就放弃运动，因为我压力太大了，我有太多事要做了，其实 最不能放弃的是运动，最不能放弃的是运动，**为什么?因为它是一项投资。**虽然你失去了45分钟，你知道：运动30分钟，之后洗个澡，我推荐大家这么做。虽然你失去了45分钟，但你获得了更多 这时间花得其所，**为什么?因为做运动 记忆力提高，所以你更能充分利用学习时间，你的创造力提高了 精神更集中，不管你是否有多动症 有就更要运动了，或者你有患多动症的趋势，即使对于没有多动症的人来说，运动也能大大提高注意力集中，活力显著提高 所以这时间花得其所。**）
* Another barrier to exercising regularly-this is an interesting one and often overlooked, **but extremely powerful- and that is the subconscious barrier.** Nathaniel Branden talks about this, and I talked about it a little bit in my book,quoting him. He talks about self-esteem and **part of self-esteem is the notion that we are worthy of happiness. The notion of being worthy of happiness.** And when you ask people,"are you worthy of happiness?" Most people would say,"yes." But if you ask the subconscious, very often,for many people,it's "no", whether it's because of the voice that we heard in the past from teachers,educators,parents,significant adults,
society at large by comparing us to unrealistic models. But very often we have this voice,the subconscious level that "we are not really worthy of happiness". And that is a barrier; that stops us from becoming happier. **Now one of the things that we know of exercise is that it's one of the- if not the most power drug for making us happier,** Now I know that exercise makes me happier; it makes me feel good. But if my subconscious thinks that I'm unworthy of these feelings,unworthy of being happy, it may in fact stop me from exercising. Why? Because remember, mind doesn't like when there is an inconsistency between what's inside and what's outside. And if what's inside is saying "shouldn't be happy", then I try to match it to what's inside.  **And I don't exercise. Because if I do exercise,then there will be a disconnect-I'll be happier than I think I'm worthy of.** There's a lot of research on this. For example, by psychologist Bill Swann, who talks about self-confirmation theory, which is a very powerful force within us. There's a self-enhancement, that we want to appear good in other people's eyes,in our eyes, but there is a counter-force,which is self-confirmation, where we want to confirm whatever we think about ourselves. **And if we think we are not worthy of happiness, we very often not do things that actually make us happy.** We see it in other areas- in relationships,for example. If I think I'm unworthy of a wonderful partner, of being happy in relationships, very often I'll often inadvertently subconscious working here, jeopardize the relationship and look for things that are not working,actively, subconsciously look for ways of hurting the relationship. So we need to be aware of the subconscious level. And very much it applies to whether or not we exercise. **So what do we do with this? A best thing to do is to just do it. Again,ritualize it. Not analyze it too much.Just go ahead and exercise. You know 3,4 times a week is good for you,just do it. And again it's the five-minute take-off that subconscious mind will try to tell you, "don't do it.You don't have the time. There are other things. You'll do it tomorrow.Next week you'll start the regime." The subconscious mind is very smart in its attempt,and will do anything that it can almost to create this congruency. When you go out and exercise and you show yourself, "yes I'm worthy of happiness." Very often the subconscious mind will follow suit. So just do it.**
(另一个阻碍定期运动的障碍――――是一个有趣但经常被忽视的障碍，这个障碍非常强大、潜意识障碍，Nathaniel Branden谈过这点，我在我的书中也略谈过 引用了他的话，他谈到自尊，**自尊隐含了一个概念:我们值得拥有幸福，值得拥有幸福。**当你问别人"你值得拥有幸福吗?"大部人会说"值得"， 但在潜意识中，通常很多人都会说"不值得"，可能因为脑袋里有一把声音说"不值得"，因为过去老师、教育工作者、父母、重要的大人、社会大众都要我们向不现实的榜样看齐，所以通常在我们潜意识里有一把声音说："我不值得拥有幸福"，这是一个障碍 使我们无法更快乐，**我们知道运动的其中一个作用就是，
可以说它是让我们变幸福的最强效药物。**我知道运动使人幸福 使人感觉良好，但如果我的潜意识认为我不值得拥有这些感觉、不值得幸福，它可能阻止我运动，为什么?大家回忆一下，意识不喜欢、潜意识与外界不一致，**如果我潜意识认为"不应该快乐"，我就会听从我的潜意识，我就不会运动，因为我运动的话就会与潜意识不一致，我会比潜意识认为的更幸福。**在这个问题上有过很多研究，例如心理学家Bill Swann 讲过自我确认理论，这是我们意识里一股很强大的力量，我们意识里有自我提高，我们想在别人和自己眼里表现出好的一面，但还有一股反作用力，就是自我确认，我们想确认对自己的了解是否属实，如果我们认为自己不值得幸福，通常我们就不会做让自己幸福的事，在其他方面也存在 例如在恋情中，如果我认为我不值得拥有好伴侣，不值得在恋情中得到幸福，通常我就会在潜意识里，破坏这段恋情，积极寻找恋情中不顺利的地方，潜意识中寻找方法伤害这段恋情，所以我们需要注意这些潜意识力量，**我们该拿它怎么办?最好的办法就是运动，再一次说回来，把它规律化，不要分析太多 尽管去运动就行了，你知道一周三四次运动对你有益，尽管去做，再一次说到，即想即做法，潜意识会告诉你，"不要做，你没时间，还有别的事要做，你明天再做，你下周再开始定期运动。"为了达到目的，潜意识会很聪明地，用尽各种方法，几乎能使你的行动听从潜意识。** **当你出去运动时，你就让自己看到:"是的，我值得拥有幸福。"**通常潜意识就会听从这个想法，所以尽管去运动。)

2. Harvard Medical School Professor, psychiatrist:"In a way, exercise can be thought of as a psychiatrist's dream treatment, It works on anxiety, on panic disorder, and on stress in general, which has a lot to do with depression. And it generates the release of neurotransmitters- norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine- that are very similar to our most important psychiatric medicines, **Having a bout of exercise is like taking a little bit of Prozac and a little bit of Ritalin,right where it is supposed to go."** The exact right amount of it.The exact right location. And without side effects. (哈佛医学院教授,精神病医生:"某种程度上,锻炼能对付焦虑症、恐慌症、普通的压力，压力和抑郁症有莫大关联，运动能释放神经递质，去甲肾上腺素、血清素、多巴胺，这些物质与重要精神类药物相似，**做一轮运动就像吃了一点百忧解，一点利他林，针对性很强。"** 正确的分量，正确的身体部位，没有副作用。)
## Meditation(冥想)
1. **enlightenment is not what meditation is about.** Meditation is about being present,being in the here and now, struggling with being in the here and now. And when we lose our thought, when we lose our focus on the breath,simply bring it back. That is the practice- losing it and bringing it back.  And that's how we exercise our mind to be more focused, to be more mindful.（**觉悟不是冥想的目的。**冥想是专注于现状，此时此刻，与此时此刻的存在作挣扎。当我们思想涣散了，当我们对呼吸分心了，集中回来就行了，这就是冥想：分心――集中，这样我们就能把思想锻炼得更专注，更留神。）
2. The easier you get startled, generally it's correlated to the higher levels of anxiety, susceptibility at least to anxiety.(越容易受到惊吓，通常说明你焦虑程度更高，至少容易产生焦虑。)
3. Goleman writes in his book:Destructive Emotions:"Given that the larger someone's startle, the more intensely that person tends to experience upsetting emotions, Oser's performance had tantalizing implications, suggesting a remarkable level of emotional equanimity." That equanimity was also contagious-so people who tried to argue with these monks, very often had a hard time becoming angry or upset, even if the topic was upset,personally upsetting to them, **Because calm is contagious, just like happiness is.**(Goleman writes在他的书中这样写道:"破坏性情绪: 一个人惊吓反应越大，那个人就越可能出现消极情绪。Oser的表现有着有趣的含意，表明他的情绪有着惊人的镇定。这种镇定还会传染，如果有人想和这些喇嘛争吵，他们会很难生起气来，即使这个话题很容易让他们生气。**因为平静是会传染的 就是快乐会传染一样。**")
4. How do we practice it? First- and this is part of their 8 week program, which is what I'm doing right now- the first is body scan. Become aware of your body, just by lying down and thinking and observing. First of all,your foot and then becoming aware of your knee, becoming aware of sensations in your crotch, becoming aware of sensations in your stomach. Wherever it is. Going through the whole body. And practicing it,becoming more aware. And this is doing it in a cold state. This is doing it in the practice,in a simulator. Then when we are in a hot state, when we actually experience that emotion,that painful emotion, we are ready to go to it and we know what to do. Practice also means when we lose focus,we go back to it. And that's the practice. The practice is not remaining completely centered for 30 minutes. The practice is losing and coming back. Losing focus and coming back again. And then,also practicing in the real life. So whenever I feel stressed,merely going"OK. So what's the physical manifestation of it?" You can also practice by using cognitive reconstruction. (Let's say I'm thinking about a talk that I have to give tonight. And I'm very nervous for it. Large audience.Important audience. And every time I think of it,my initial inclination is stress. And I get this adrenalin feel here and I don't feel good about it. Or the knot in my stomach. So how do I deal with it? Each time I think about it,I say, "OK.Where am I feeling it in the body?" Another way of dealing with it is cognitively reconstructing it, saying instead of stress,what a privilege. Remember I told you that I had a very large client that I had to speak to, I was very stressed about that talk. And every time my mind went to stress, within half a second I said,"no,it's a privilege. It's so wonderful that I have the opportunity to do it." Again,this is different from avoiding. This is different from repressing. There is a time to simply accept and to give ourselves the permission to be human. However it's useless to just constantly ruminate about it and simply strengthen the neural pathways. So this reaction of either going to the physical body or sometimes going to the cognitive reconstruction can be very useful. Remember when we want change, we want to draw as much as possible on A,B and C--- on affect,on behavior,and cognition.（我们怎么练习?首先 这是书中的八周疗法中的一部分，我现在也在练 首先是身体扫描，了解你的身体，躺下来，思考、观察，先从你的脚开始，然后了解你的膝盖，了解你胯部的感觉，了解你胃的感觉，每一个身体部位都是，了解整个身体，多练习，多了解。这是冷状态下的练习，在模拟状态下的练习，当我们在热状态下、当我们真正感受到那种痛苦情绪时，我们就准备好用这种方法，我们知道怎么用。练习时 如果我们精神分散了，再集中起来，这是练习。练习并不表示30分钟都要完全集中注意力，练习时精神分散了就再集中，精神分散了――――再集中，然后在现实生活中也要练习，所以当我感到压力时 我想”好的，这种情绪引起什么身体反应?“ 你们也可以用认知重建来练习，怎样练习？ 举个例子，例如我想到今晚我要做的一个讲座，我感到很紧张，很多观众，重要的观众，每次想到这，我第一个反应就是紧张，我感受到这里的肾上腺素，很难受，感到我胃打了一个结，我怎么办？每次想到这讲座，我就会想”好的 这个身体反应在哪里?“另一个方法就是用认知重建它，不要觉得它是压力，觉得它是荣幸，我刚才说过，我要跟一个很大的客户谈，我为这次演讲感到很大压力，每次我脑袋想到这压力时，马上我跟自己说”不，这是荣幸，我能有这样的机会做讲座真是太棒了。“重申，这不同于逃避，不同于抑制，有时候只需要接受它，明白这是人之常情。但是，苦苦思索这种情绪上是没用的，只会加强这条神经通路，这种反应，或者专注于身体，或者专注于认知重建，都很有用。记得，当我们想改变时，我们要想到尽可能多的可能性，想到情感、行为、认知（ABC）的方法）
5. "With the shift trying to ignore or eliminate physical discomfort to paying attention with friendly curiosity, we can transform- quite literally transform our experience."（”不再尝试无视和消除身体不适，而是抱着关怀之心去关注它，我们就能真真正正地改变我们的感受。“）
6. I'm going to leave you today with a last tip. And this is something that is very important, and that I highly recommend doing- for all of you,no exception. What I highly recommend doing is breathing. It's very,very important to breathe. And in fact,it's the one thing that's common to all the mindful meditation practices, and something that you can introduce to your life-of course I mean proper breathing. Something that you can introduce to your life, even if you don't meditate for 15 minutes or 45 minutes a day. What I'm talking about here is deep breathing. Because here is what happens: in our modern world,we are mostly stressed and anxious. As a result of this,our breathing becomes shallow. And as a result of shallow breathing, when our breathing is shallow, we become even more stressed and anxious. And we go into this vicious cycle, vicious downward spiral of the "fight or flight" response. And that's how we go through most of our days. Fortunately we can reverse this. And we can reverse this very quickly. Because we also know that calm and well being leads to deep breathing; and deep breathing in turn leads to calm and well being. We can reverse the "fight or flight" response and enter what Herbert Benson calls, the relaxation response within as little as three deep breaths. We can introduce these three deep breaths strategically throughout the day. Just before class starts; just when the class ends; just when I wake up in the morning; or the last thing before I go to bed. Three deep breaths, strategic points through the day can transform a life.(今天我教大家最后一个方法，这个方法很重要，我非常推荐你们所有人都要学，没有例外，我非常推荐的方法是呼吸，呼吸很重要，事实上，它是唯一一个所有正念冥想的共通点，你可以把它应用于生活中，当然我所说的呼吸是正确呼吸，你可以应用到你的生活中，即使你没有一天冥想15分钟或45分钟，我所说的呼吸是深呼吸。因为现实情况是，在现代世界，我们经常感到紧张焦虑，因此我们的呼吸变得很浅，因为呼吸很浅，当我们呼吸浅时，我们就变得更紧张焦虑，我们就会陷入一个恶性循环，一个”或战或逃反应“的恶性循环，我们平常就是这样处理的。庆幸的是我们可以扭转这种循环，我们可以马上扭转它，因为我们还知道，平静和健康促进我们深呼吸，深呼吸又能反过来促进平静和健康，我们可以扭转这种”或战或逃“的反应，进入Herbert Benson所说的”放松反应 只需三个深呼吸的时间。“我们可以把这三个深呼吸的方法有计划地应用在一天的生活中，上课前，下课后，早上醒来时，或者上床睡觉前。”三个深呼吸“，有计划地按排到一天的时间点上，能改变你的人生)

# Lesson 18. The importance of Sleepping, touch and Love.(睡眠、触摸和爱情的重要性)
## Sleepping
1. Now many people are saying,"OK. For me to get 8 hours sleep,I'll need 30-hour days. It's not enough to...It's a third of 24 hours. That's too much.I can't afford it." Well you can afford it if you look at it as an investment, if you make it a priority.(现在有些人会说：”好吧，对我来说，要睡8小时的话，我一天要有30小时才行，没有足够的时间去。。。那是一天的三分之一啊，太多了，我腾不出那么多时间。“你可以腾出那么多时间，如果你把它视作一种投资的话，如果你把它当做一件优先要做的事的话。)
2. The second reason is a little bit more subtle and a little bit more interesting. What happens at night is that our mind processes a lot of the things that we have gone through throughout the day. And very often it solves unresolved issues that we have gone through throughout the day,which is why,
you know you go to sleep with a math problem, often you wake up in the morning with a solution. But it's not just math problems that are solved at night. It is also other interpersonal, intrapersonal issues that are solved throughout the night. And if you look at dreams-usually the dreams that we have early on during the night are actually less pleasant,enjoyable dreams. We are more likely to have pleasant dreams later on in the night. Why? Because the first part of the night, that's when we are working on problems, we are dealing with issues- some were conscious; some were not conscious during the day. Later on after we have resolved a few of these problems, our dreams become more pleasant. Again,this doesn't mean you can't have a nightmare at 11:30 am. But it means that you are more likely to have bad dreams earlier on. And when we don't give ourselves the opportunity to "complete our dreaming"-complete problem solving through that night, we wake up with that problem unresolved. And then it's there. whether it's on the conscious or subconscious level. It's unresolved.And we pay a price for it. And over time,we have a lot of unresolved issues, especially when they are suppressed or repressed, when we are more likely to enter depression. So sleep for the physical need of sleep
as well as for the psychological need of sleep. (第二个原因是，有一点点微妙也有一点点有趣，晚上，我们的大脑要处理很多我们白天经历的事情，它经常解决我们白天经历过的，未解决的问题，这就是为什么，你知道，你带着一个数学问题入睡，经常你会在早上醒来时得到解答。但不只是数学问题在晚上得到解决，还有其他人际问题，内心里的问题要在整个晚上解决，比如说梦，通常我们晚上做得比较早的梦，都是比较不愉快的梦，我们在夜里晚些时候做的梦更容易是愉快的梦，为什么？因为晚上的第一部分，是我们解决问题的时候，我们在解决问题，有些是有意识的，有些问题则没有意识，我们解决了一些问题之后，我们的梦就变得更为愉快了。重申，这并不意味着你在上午11点半就不会做噩梦，它的意思是你睡眠初期做噩梦的可能性更高，当我们不给自己机会去"完成dreaming"，在睡眠中解决问题，那我们醒来我问题就任然在。这个问题还在。不管你意没意识到，问题还没解决，我们要为此付出代价，随着时间过去，我们有许多未解决的问题，特别是当它们被压抑或抑制的时候，那时候我则更有可能变得抑郁，所以为了生理的睡眠需要睡觉，同样也为了心理的睡眠需要睡觉。)
3. How to get a good sleep?
	* Not to eat too much before you go to sleep. Watch your exercise regime-- not to exercise too late.(睡前不要吃太多。注意自己的锻炼安排，不要在太晚的时候锻炼。)
	* **Permission to be human**. Sometimes when i did have problems during difficult periods, stressful periods, initially i would tell myself, "OK.Fall asleep now.Fall asleep now.Fall asleep." Right? It's like "Don't be anxious.Don't be anxious." And then you have pink elephants preventing you from going to sleep. Instead give yourself permission to be human. Now I have difficulty falling asleep I said to myself, "well,it's an opportunity to think and reflect." And very often that bores me and I fall asleep. Permission to be human.(**准许为人(不要强人所难)**，有时，在困难时期、压力时期，我遇到问题的时候，最初的时候我告诉自己：”好吧，现在睡觉，现在睡觉，睡觉。。。“对吧？就像是”别焦虑，别焦虑“一样，然后你有了幻觉，它阻碍你入眠，不要强自己所难。现在我入眠有困难，我就对自己说：”嗯 这是个思考和反省的机会。“常常我会想得烦了就睡着了。不要强自己所难。
	* And finally, what are your internal rhythms? Now because we have the light bulb today, because we are living indoors as opposed to living in huts that are exposed or caves that are in touch, directly in touch with nature. We have separated ourselves with,from nature. And we pay a price for it. Whether we pay a price for it because we don't exercise enough since we don't have to hunt and gather. And we pay a price also because we don't pay attention, we are no longer cognizant, mindful or heartful of our internal rhythms. How many hours in night do you need? Are you a night person or a morning person? Do you need to go to sleep at 10 pm? Or do you need to go to sleep at 5 am? What's right for you? **Try and create a life that is in line with your natural needs.** That's not always possible. Still as much as possible trying to be aware, cognizant of your internal rhythms in terms of the hours that you need, and also when you need those hours. (最后,你内在的节律是什么？如今因为我们有了电灯，因为我们住在室内而非暴露的小屋（和与大自然相联系），直接相联系的洞穴，我们把自己从大自然中隔离了出来，我们也为此付出代价，不论是因为我们不需要狩猎和收割，因而锻炼不足而付出代价，还是因为我们不注意、我们不再认识、留意或关心自身的内在节律而付出代价。你晚上需要多少时间？你是夜猫子还是早起鸟？你需要晚上10点睡觉吗？或者你需要早上5点睡觉吗？什么时间适合你？**试着去创造一个和你天性需求一致的生活**，这并非总是能做到，但还是尽可能地知道，认识到自己的内在节律，比如你需要多少睡眠时间？你什么时候需要睡觉？)
## Touch
1. Tiffany Field and other people's reseach shows how important getting in touch with touch is. For example,for physical health- whether it's our immune system strengthens significantly with touch, weakens drastically without sufficient touch. It helps overcome injuries. And that's not just professional massagist, or professional physiotherapist. Just the act of touch. Children grow more when they are touched. And we'll talk about research in a minute- some mind-boggling research. It's physical health; it's also mental health. Once again, children's cognitive development is affected by touch- mental health in terms of mood disorders, eating disorders are associated very often with lack of touch or not enough touch. Depression and anxiety are caused by lack of touch, can be overcomed often with more touch.(Tiffany Field博士以及其他研究者的研究展示了在人与人的接触中触摸的重要性。例如，对于身体健康来说，不论是我们的免疫系统因为触摸而大大增强，还因为缺少足够的触摸而严重地降低，触摸有助伤口愈合，不需要专业的按摩师，不需要专业的理疗师，简简单单的触摸就可以了。儿童在受到触摸时成长得更好，我们一会会谈到一些研究，一些叹为观止的研究，它关系到身体健康，也关系到精神健康。再一次，儿童的认知发展受到触摸的影响，在心境障碍，饮食失调方面的精神健康常常与缺乏触摸，或触摸不足有关，由缺乏触摸引起的抑郁和焦虑可以通过加强触摸得到克服。)
2. Hopefully you are convinced now: better sex life with touch. William Masters and Virginia Johnson, two of the most important sex therapists and researchers. What they have shown is that sexual dysfunction, most sexual dysfunctions- in fact,between 70 and 95 percent of them can be solved simply with the help of touch. So what they are saying actually is that foreplay should not be just used as a means toward an end; they are saying that it can be an end in itself. And what touch does is essentially what positive psychology is all about. So what positive psychology is about is- remember,getting us from the negative to the zero, but then getting us from the zero to the positive. touch contributes to a thriving sexual relationship. So it's not just helping with problems; it's also making,taking us from the zero to the thriving. (希望你们现在确信了：触摸能改善性生活。William Masters和Virginia Johnson两位最重要的性治疗师及研究者，他们的研究表明性功能障碍、大部分性功能障碍，实际上 有70%到95%是可以简单地在触摸的帮助下得到解决的，所以他们所认为的实际上是，前戏不应该只是达到目的的手段，他们认为前戏本身也可以是目的。触摸起到的作用本质上来说，正是幸福心理学的内容。所以幸福心理学的目标就是：记住，让我们从消极达到零点，再让我们从零点到达幸福。触摸能活跃性生活，所以它不只是解决问题，它还让我们从零点变成活跃。)
3. Now touch is a need.As I said earlier,just like...Touch is a need just like physical exercise is a need, just like food and sleep are needs.(触摸是一个需要，如我之前所说，正如。。。，触摸是一种需要，正如身体锻炼是一种需要，正如吃饭睡觉是需要一样。)
4. The story about premature babies(医院早产儿的故事，被触摸的婴儿身体好的更快，更健康，更好的认知能力，显示了触摸对婴儿的重要性。)
5. Unfortunately it has been done on human beings. This is one of the largest,natural,tragic experiments ever carried out. This was specifically done in Romania under  Ceau?escu- the cruel dictator that ruled over the country until 1989. One thing that he did was take many kids away from their parents, especially if the parents were dissident, the parents were not "cultural" communists So he took their kids and raised 150,000 kids in homes away from their parents. Now these homes- because it was a very poor country, had no money for nurses,for enough nurses, had no money for enough supports staff in general. So while these kids got all their physical needs in terms of food water and they were cleaned, they did not get much affection, not because the nurses did not want to give them affection. They just didn't have the time. In 1989,the war fell. Ceau?escu was ousted. And these kids were released from these homes. And psychologist went in and what they saw was the result of this tragic,natural experiment. In terms of physical growth, these kids were between 3 and 10 percent in size relative to their age group. Cognitive growth- the level of,way below the 100 IQ average. Motor development- also impaired significantly as a result of lack of touch. And many of these kids were sitting down with their legs to their chest and just rocking. The effect of touch deprivation.(不幸的是，这研究在人身上做过，这是人类实施过的最大的、悲剧的自然实验之一，这个实验是在齐奥塞斯库统治下的罗马尼亚完成的，那个残暴的独裁者统治着这个国家直到1989年，他做的一件事就是把许多孩子从父母身边带走，特别是那些父母与之政见不同的、那些父母不是“有文化”的共产党员，所以他把15万个孩子带到收养所养育，远离他们的父母，现在这些收容所，因为那是个非常贫穷的国家，没有钱提供看护、足够的看护，没有钱请足够的工作人员。这些孩子的身体需求得到满足，有食物、水、还能洗澡，但他们并没有得到爱，不是因为那些看护不愿意给他们爱，而是她们没有那个时间。在1989年，战争爆发，齐奥塞斯库被驱逐，这些孩子被从这些收容所里释放，心理学家去收容所里，他们看到的是这个悲剧的自然实验的后果，在身体成长方面，这些孩子中只有3%到10%的人与他们同年龄段孩子的体型是相当的。认知力发展方面，水平远远低于100的平均智商，运动发育方面，同样也由于缺乏触摸而严重受损，许多孩子抱着腿坐着，不停地摇晃。触摸剥夺的影响。)
6. The importance of touch. Virginia Satir who's a psychologist has this to say: "We need 4 hugs a day for survival. We need 8 hugs a day for maintenance. We need 12 hugs a day for growth." So there is though actual research on hugs. So this is Jane Clipman who did research. And here is the intervention- very simple. It was every day give at least 5 hugs. These are frontal hugs,you know not with your partner- just hugs to different people,friends. Can be your partner as well. But these are specifically nonsexual hugs. And she found after 4 week was that the people who were in this group as opposed to the control group- and the control group had to write how many hours a day they read The control group's level of happiness obviously didn't go up. **The group that hugged 5 times a day went up significantly.** Now this exercise,this experiment when she talks about, she says it was much more difficult for some people, especially for men. But even the men who were part of it,most of them hugged. So they would do it on the sports field. They would find opportunities or somehow got in 5 hugs a day. And those people who did that actually became happier. **So it's a very strong recommendation and suggestion, from now on till, and the rest of your life- at least 5 hugs,preferably 12. The nice thing about hugs is that it's a win-win. Because when we hug someone,we are hugged back; when we touch someone,we are touched back. It's like happiness.When we share it,it grows. It's a win-win,positive sum game.** Important thing to keep in mind about hugs, and touch in general is to respect the other person. Because not everyone feels as comfortable being touched as we do. Or we may not feel comfortable being touched. And that's fine for many reasons. You know one could be upbringing; one could be just physically people are different- there are some people who enjoy touch much more than others. And that's fine; it's natural. **So we need to respect other people's boundaries as well as have others respect our own.**(触摸的重要性，心理学家Virginia Satir如是说：”我们一天需要4个拥抱才能存活，我们一天需要8个拥抱才能维持，我们一天需要12个拥抱才能成长。“不过还有一个关于拥抱的研究，这是Jane Clipman做的研究，属于一个心理干预，很简单，一天至少5个拥抱，面对面的拥抱、不是和你的情侣就是拥抱，拥抱不同的人、朋友，也可以是你的情侣，但这些明确地是和性无关的拥抱。然后她发现4周后，这一组的人，与对照组不同，对照组的人要写出他们每天读了多少小时的书，对照组的幸福水平明显没有提高，**每天拥抱5次的那组却显著提高**。她谈论起这个实验时说，对某些人来说，拥抱要困难得多，特别是男人，但即使这样，参与这组的男人大部分还是拥抱了，他们可以在运动场上拥抱，他们可以找机会或者想方设法地一天拥抱5次，而这些这么做了的人真的变得更快乐了。**但我推荐你们去做，强烈推荐和建议，从现在开始，在你以后的日子里，至少5个拥抱，12个更好。拥抱的好处就是它是双赢的，因为当我们拥抱某人时，我们也被拥抱了，当我们触摸某人时，我们也被触摸了。就像幸福，当我们分享它的时候，它就越来越多。这是个双赢、正正得正的游戏。**关于拥抱和触摸有个重要的事要记住，那就是要尊重对方，因为不是每个人被触摸时都会像我们一样感觉良好的，或者我们被触摸可能感觉会不舒服。那没有关系，有许多原因，你知道有人可能比较有教养，有人可能只是身体上不习惯，**人和人是不同的**。有些人更喜欢被触摸，那没关系，这是自然的。**所以我们需要尊重别人的界线，也要让别人尊重我们的。**)
7. Dr.Tal Ben-Shahar: OK, So onece again, here is the prescription, very simple:(再一次，这是我们的药方，非常简单：)
	* 4 times at least a week, 30 minutes of physical exercise at least.(一周至少4次，一次至少30分支的身体锻炼。)
	* Mindfulness meditation. If it's good for you, every day 10 or 15 minutes. If not, at the very least, a few deep breaths strategically place throughout the day. (正念冥想，如果你方便的话，每天10或15分钟，如果不方便，至少全天也要有安排地做几个深呼吸。)
	* 8 hours of sleep at night and at least 5, ideally 12 hugs a day.(晚上8小时的睡眠，一天至少5个，最好12个拥抱。)
This is probably the most powerful psychological prescription that you will ever get or hear about. and all it does is bring us back to our base level of well being, our God given or genes level, genes given level of happiness. (这可能是你听说过的，最有效力的心理学药方了。它能让我们处于自然健康状态，我们天生的或者基因决定的水平、幸福水平。)
## Love
1. **The key though in relationships is to know yourself, meaning to know your needs. Because we don't all have the same relationship need.** There is no one prescription.(**在人际关系中的关键是认识自己，就是知道自己的需要，因为我们每个人需要的人际关系都不一样。**没有统一的药方。)
2. The Lasagna Principle: we all need... **example i gave there is so i love my family- the most important thing in the world to me. However that doesn't mean i want to spend, you know, 8 or 10 hours a day with my family every day all day.** you know i also need my quota of solitude. i need my Yoga. I need my exercise, my writing, my teaching. That does not mean that my family is any less important to me. (千层面定律：那就是我们都需要。。。**比方说，我很爱我的家人――家人对我来说是世界上最重要的，但那并不以为着我愿意一天花8个或者10个小时和家人在一起，** 你知道我还需要独处的时间配额，我需要练瑜伽，我需要锻炼，写作，教学，那并不意味着我的家人对我来说就不重要了。(Tal 偶尔一次告诉妈妈爱吃千层饼，之后他妈妈就每天给他做，导致Tal后来见到千层饼就怕了，这个例子告诉我们，凡事过犹不及。))
3. you need find your quota- the same with relationships. **Ask yourself: How many hours a day is good for me, pleasant for me, enjoyable for me to spend with other people.** One of the things that differentiates people in terms of the right amount is introversion and extroversion. **we actually have physiological, base level of where we are compared to the optimum( average on all humans).** And we are all born somewhere around this, either above, below ,very few people are right on the line. **Introverts have a higher level of arousal, higher innate level of arousal,** Extroverts have a lower level of arousal, compared to te optimum level. **Now we all physically see, or emotionally, cognitively and physically, Look for experiencing the optimum level of arousal, Because that's the most convenient. That's when we are at our best. That's when we enjoy ourselves more.** **which is why introverts whose innate natural state is above the optimum level of arousal, actually need to reduce level of arousal. so they enjoy spending time by themselves.** In contrast, extroverts have a lower arousal level. and it's not as pleasant as when they get it to the optimum level, so they go out to a party where there is a lot of arousal, a lot of things happening, a lot of people in order to get their optimum level of arousal, **which is why generally...What does alcohol do? Alcohol reduces our level of arousal, which is why introverts very often need a glass of wine, or a bottle before they dance. Because to dance while other people are watching increases level of arousal, so what the alcohol does is reduce their level of arousal. And then dancing is comfortable and they are fine with it. In ontrast, many extroverts need coffee, which is stimulant in order to stay awake. Because the coffee gets them up to their optimum level of arousal,** ( 你需要找到适合自己的配额，人际关系也是一样。**问问自己，每天和别人相处多少小时，我就觉得愉快，觉得和人相处是一种享受。**决定这个合适时间的因素就是看你是内向还是外向，**我们都有一个相对于最优水平而言的心理基准水平。** 我们生来就在这附近(人类平均值)，有些人高，有些人低，极少有人正好在这条线上。**内向的人有更高的激励水平，更高的先天激励水平。**  相对于最优水平而言，外向的人有较低的激励水平。**现在我们身体上，或者精神上、认知上并身体上都在寻求体验的最优激励水平，因为那是最方便的，那时候我们在最佳状态，那时候我们心情更愉快。** **这也就是为什么内向的人，天生自然状态是高于最优激励水平的人，他们实际上需要降低刺激水平，所以他们喜欢自己单独呆着。** 与之相反，外向的人有着较低的激励水平，这个水平没有达到最优水平时那么愉快，于是他们出门去参加派对，那里有许多刺激，有很多事情发生，有很多为了达到自己最优水平的人， **这就是为什么普遍来说。。。酒精起什么作用？酒精降低我们的激励水平，这就是为什么内向的人常常需要在他们跳舞前喝杯酒或者喝瓶酒，因为当着其他人的面跳舞会刺激水平上升，所以酒精的作用是降低他们的刺激水平，然后跳舞就容易接受了。与之相反，外向的人需要咖啡，咖啡是保持清醒的刺激物，因为咖啡让他们上升到自己的最优激励水平。**)
4. Brian Little: **We cannot act out of nature(can temporary, and remember to recover),** meaning an introvert can act like an extrovert. Here I am- I'm an introvert and- by the way this is physio... We are born with this state.It's innate. So I was born an introvert. And yet when I'm standing in front of the class, and sing beautiful songs,I'm acting like an extrovert. **However the important thing while we can act out of nature is to understand that very often this enervates us. It takes away energy.**It's difficult for us because we are acting so if I'm here, when I teach,I go even higher- even further from my optimum level of arousal. **And that takes away energy which is why introverts after acting like an extrovert whether it's at a party or in a lecture, need what Brian Little calls a restorative niche.** A restorative niche- a place to restore. And that would be a place where they would spend time one on one with someone, or some hours of solitude,of recovery. **Remember,the problem is not stress. The problem is not stress. The problem is when we don't have recovery. And introverts need recovery. Some time on their own.Some time one on one. ** Same with an extrovert.**If you are an extrovert, sometimes you have to do introverts' stuff. So for example you need to study for an exam. And yet it would be nice to study for an exam at the Cog, but may be not that helpful. So you are studying by yourself or with one person. And what do you need after that is a restorative niche, because it's enervating for an extrovert to be far from their optimum level of arousal. You need a restorative niche. Where is that restorative niche? I need to go out for a party with friends. And that for them is a restorative niche.** **So again,know thyself. Know what your relationship needs are. Doesn't mean you cannot act out of the nature. You can. But at the same time it must be able to have a formal recovery, a restorative niche according to your first nature, being an introvert or an extrovert. To summarize,the number of relationships that you need that would be best for you- depends on your personal,unique needs. The number of hours you want to spend with other people differs for everyone. There's no right or wrong here. Doesn't mean you love people any less. Or neither does it mean that you don't need intimate relationships if you are one or the other. Both need close intimate relationships-soul mates,romantic partners,family members- whatever it is.It's a need.**

(Brian Little：**我们的举止不能脱离本性（可以短暂脱离，但记得及时恢复）。** 就是说一个内向的人可以举止像外向的人，我站在这里，我是个内向的人，顺便说下这是我们生来就是这个状态，这是天生的，我生来就是内向的，但当我站在教室前，唱着优美的歌曲，我的行为像一个外向的人。**但是当我们的举止脱离本性时，明白这样通常会让我们衰弱这点很重要，它会带走我们的精力。**这对我们来说很难，因为我们在假装，所以如果当我上课时，我会变得更兴奋，离我的最优激励水平更远，这会消耗精力，**这就是为什么内向的人在表现得像外向的人之后，无论是参加派对还是讲课，都需要Brian Little所说的恢复龛。**恢复龛，一个恢复精力的地方，在那个地方，人们可以和人一对一相处，也可以给自己一点时间独处，恢复。**记住，这个问题不是压力，而是我们没有恢复，内向的人需要恢复，有时是靠自己，有时需要一对一。**外向的人也是一样，**如果你是个外向的人，有时你不得不做点内向的人的事情，比如说你需要为了考试学习，你是可以和很多人一起学习备考，但可能效果并没有那么好，所以你自己一个人或者和另一个人一起学习，而在那之后你需要的就是一个恢复龛，因为对一个外向的人来说，远离其最优激励水平是消耗精力的，你需要一个恢复龛，恢复龛在哪？我需要和朋友出去参加派对，这对他们来说就是一个恢复龛。** **所以再一次 认识你自己。知道你自己人际关系的需求是什么？不是说你的行为不能脱离本性，你可以，但同时你必须要有一个正式的恢复，一个与你本性相对应的恢复龛，不管你是内向的还是外向的。简而言之，你需要的人际关系数量取决于你个人的独特的需要，你想和别人在一起相处的时间因人而异，这里无分好坏，这并不意味着你对别人的爱就冷淡了，也不意味着如果你是前一种或者后一种的人，你就不需要亲密的关系了，两种人都需要亲密的关系，和灵魂伴侣、情侣、家人。。。都可以，这是一种需要。**)
5. Love, and especially lust and passion wears over time. (爱情，尤其是欲望和热情会随着时间磨灭。)
6. Daryl Bem:"the exotic is erotic."(Daryl Bem：”新奇的总是引人性致的。“)
7. When would you become more physically aroused? In general- does not always happen- but overwhelming majority of times. **You'll become more physically aroused when the new person comes in.** Why? Because the exotic is erotic. Because novelty excites.(你什么时候身体上更兴奋？总得来说，虽不是总是发生，但大多数情况是，**你会在那个生人进来时身体上更兴奋。** 为什么？因为新奇的总是引人性致的，因为新鲜的事物有刺激。)
8. The first step before accepting reality is understanding what true love really means. **you see there is no perfect love. To expect this of myself, of my partner, of our relationship is to set us up for failure. We set ourselves up for failure when our expectations are larger than life, when our expectations are perfect lines, perfect love.** **But while perfect love doesn't exist, true love does, True love exists between imperfect humans.** **What is true love? How can positive psychology help us identify it?** (接受现实的第一步是明白爱情的真谛是什么？ **你知道，完美的爱情是不存在的，去期望自己，自己的情侣，自己的人际关系这么完美，注定会失败。当我们的期望是完美的台词，或完美的爱情时，我们就是在为自己的失败做着准备。**   **但是尽管完美的爱情不存在，真爱却存在，存在于不完美的人中。**) 
9. The key was to study successful relationship, whatever the relationship was ,whatever its nature was.(总之，关键是要去研究成功的关系，不管这个关系是什么，不管它的本质是什么。)
10. The right question is：What makes some relationships thrive and grow stronger over time?(婚姻中问的正确问题是：”什么让这些关系（维持激情婚姻）发展良好，并随着时间越来越好？“)
11. John Gottman:"At first,when I figured out how to predict divorce, I thought I had found the key to saving marriages. But like so many experts before me,I was wrong. I was not able to crack the code to saving marriages until I started to analyze what went right in happy marriages."(John Gottman：”首先，当我想出怎么预测离婚时，我以为我找到了拯救婚姻的钥匙，但和我之前的许多专家一样，我错了，我没能破解拯救婚姻的密码，直到我开始分析在幸福的婚姻里什么是对的。“)
12. David Schnarch, says in his wonderful book "Passionate Marriage":**"Cellulite and sexual potential are highly correlated."** what he showed in his research studying the best relationships is that not only do they enjoy spending time together over the years, but the best sex that they have in their lives doesn't come when they are 18 or 25 or 35. It actually is for 50 and 60 years olds. that does not mean it can't be great at 18. It can even be greater at 50 and 60.

( David Schnarch在他的那本非常棒《激情婚姻》书中写到：**”橘皮组织和性潜能是高度联系的。“**他研究最成功的关系的结果表明，**他们多年来享受一起的时光，而且他们这辈子最棒的性爱，并不是在他们18岁或25岁或35岁时，事实上是在50多岁和60多岁时。**这不是说18岁时的性爱就不好了，只是在50和60多岁时会更好。 )

12. Four different topics:
* Fist- that **relationship is about hard work.** If you want to thrive at work,you need to work hard; if you want to thrive in a relationship,you need to invest. and we'll talk about how to invest.(首先，**维持恋情需要努力。**如果你想在工作上有好的发展，你需要努力工作，如果你想在关系上有良好发展，你需要投资。我们会讲到怎样投资。)
* Second- That the best relationships are ones that create high levels of intimacy that get to know one another in a deeper level. And these are the relationships that thrive. These are the relationships that also maintain passion and enhance passion 5,10,and 50 years hence; (其次，最好的关系是创造了高水平的亲密关系，让彼此之间有更深层次的了解。这些是良好的关系，这些是保持激情的关系，并且随着时间过去，感情升温。)
* the best relationships are not relationships that are devoid of conflict- and we'll talk about what that means and what that looks like.(最好的关系并不能避免冲突，我们会降到其涵义及其状态。)
* **And finally we are in a positive psychology class. It is about appreciating the positive. Because when we appreciate the good,the good appreciates, whether in ourselves or in others.**(**最后，我们在是在上幸福心理学的课，这是关于欣赏积极事物的课，因为当我们欣赏好的事物时，好的事物会青睐我们及他人。**)

# Lesson 19. How to sustain Love?(如何让爱情天长地久) 
1. How to solve conflict?
	* Sherif:" **That the important thing in resolving conflicts is having a super ordinate goal.** When the two ethnic groups,when the two nations work together, and are inter-dependent- whether it's in business,or in a relationship, it could be raising children- but doing the things together, or belonging to the same political campaign, or opposite political campaigns- that's fine. **But working together, supporting one another and when you have the working together, the doing together,that's when you are most likely to resolve the conflicts.** **And in fact these conflicts as we'll see shortly can make the relationship even stronger.** But the couple need mutually meaningful goals. And again, **it could be having children together and raising the children together.** You know not just the "OK.We had the child. And then the mother or the father raise the kid- more often the mother." And OK.So we did something together.No. **The kid has to be to put in a very delicate and- I'm sure appropriate terms- the kid has to be a joint venture.** Isn't it a lovely term to describe having kids? As long as they don't bring any bad debt or you know there is a good return on investment. Yeah,just the right language there. Took me a while to think about it. **So working together,bringing up the kids together, or being on campaigns together, or helping one another at work but doing things together.** "(Sherif的建议：“**解决冲突的要点之一，在于确立一个超然目标。** 当两个民族或国家共同努力，彼此互助，无论在公事上还是恋情上，例如共同抚养孩子，只要共同努力，不管属于同一个政治阵营，还是相对立的两个政治阵营，都可以，**只要共同努力，彼此支持对方，当你们共同努力，共同参与时，才是你们可能解决冲突之时。** **我们很快就会看到这样的冲突反而还能让恋情变得更加巩固。** 但情侣间需要共同的有意义的目标，再说一遍,**可以是一起要个孩子，共同抚养。**而不是“我们有个孩子，由父亲或母亲抚养，通常会是母亲这样。”这样不算是共同努力了。**孩子必须处于一种微妙的位置，用专业术语来说，孩子应是合资企业。** 用这个术语来比喻生孩子是不是很有爱？只要他们不带来任何坏账。对他们的投资会带来很好的回报，非常适合的经济学术语。琢磨琢磨一下就往上套。**共同做事，共同抚育孩子。或是共同参与竞选，或在工作上给对方帮助，但要共同为之。**”)
2. John Gottman: "**In the strongest marriages, husband and wife share a deep sense of meaning. They don't just "get along"- they also support each other's hopes and aspirations and build a sense of purpose into their lives together.**" That doesn't mean that they have to do everything together. I mean it's OK for one to have his or her own meaningful goals at work, where they don't work together- that's perfectly fine. **But in addition there have to be things that are done together. In other words,what we need is an active kind of love.**
	(John Gottman：“**最稳固的婚姻里，丈夫与妻子彼此间深度融合，他们不只是一起生活，他们还支持彼此的愿望与抱负，为他们的生活融入共同的目标。**”这不是说他们要什么都一起做，我的意思是，他或她可以在工作上有自己的目标，而他们并不一起工作，这完全没问题，**但是必须要有他们共同做的事，换言之，我们需要的是主动的爱情(Tal朋友见到自己小孩第一面，并没有感觉到有那么爱这个小孩，但当他经历照顾小孩，给他换尿布，给他喂奶...后，他感受到了自己对小孩的深刻的爱。)。**)
	
	* David Schnarch: **Being known rather than being validated mean.** It means if we want to sustain passion beyond the honeymoon phase, beyond the time when it's automatic, what we need to do is form deeper levels of intimacy. And how do you cultivate intimacy? By getting to know one another more and more, more deeply,more meaningfully. By understanding one another, by getting to know one another as we know ourselves. **And that means that if we are up to be known by the other partner that means we must open up. That means we must reveal. That means we need to share of ourselves- not just the wonderful and the amazing and the terrific things that we share on the first date.That too. But in addition, also the things that sometimes we are not that proud of. Our weaknesses perhaps. Some of the things that maybe we are ashamed of, that we don't feel very comfortable... That no one knows about us.**
	(**追求被了解而不是被认可。** 什么叫被了解而非被认可呢？他表示 如果我们想在蜜月期后、在一见钟情后，仍然维持着激情，我们就得形成深层次的亲密关系。你们知道怎样培养亲密关系吗？通过逐渐了解对方，逐渐加深了解，通过理解对方，通过像了解自己一样了解对方，**这意味着，我们若决心让对方了解自己，我们就必须打开心扉，我们必须吐露心声，这意味着我们得彼此分享，不只是那些在首次约会分享的精彩美妙的事，当然也包括这些。但是除此以外，还包括一些让我们不怎么自豪的事，也许是我们的缺点，也许是我们耻于提及的、让我们觉得不舒服、不为人知的事情。**)
	* **a healthy relationship is about expressing ourselves rather than trying to constantly impress. This is the difference between being known- express versus being validated- let me impress her; let me impress him; let me impress them.** The thing about this is that- yes, it is more risky to open up,to express ourselves. Because what if she doesn't like me? What if he doesn't like what he finds out about me? But you see when we express, we are more likely to have a thriving relationship- it's not guaranteed by any stretch of imagination. It's not guaranteed. However if we just impress,we are guaranteed failure. Here is why. First of all,when we express,generally,over time, maybe not in the short term,but over time, people will be more attracted to us,- specifically my partner will like me even more over time because of our deeper levels of intimacy, even they sometimes find out things that they don't necessarily like or adore or appreciate. **Over time it's people who are genuine, who will attract other people** and- by the way this applies in the realm of C of course- interpersonal relationships. It applies in the realm of friendships. And it applies in the realm of leadership- **the greatest leaders, as Peter Drucker has illustrated, are not the people who are the most charismatic. They are not the people who are the most engaging. They are the people who have the highest levels of integrity. These are the leaders whom followers follow over time in a long term. So whether it's interpersonal group relationships or individual relationships, when we express ourselves,we are much more likely to thrive.**  **The second thing though is, that's important to keep in mind is that let's say I impress and I do such a good job of it that the other person or the other group actually likes me. It worked. I won. Well,have I? Who do they really like? Do they like me or do they like that image, that facade that I put on. In other words,it's not me that they really like. And it may look like it.But it's pretense. It's make-believe.It's not the real thing.In other words,I lose. And it certainly cannot sustain itself over time. So we have more likelihood of succeeding when we express; and zero likelihood of succeeding in the long term when our primary objective is impress.** Now this does not mean going on first date and not trying to impress. I mean I've not met anyone who has not tried to impress on the first date or the 10th, or after 10 years- that's OK. **However, what is the primary motivator in our time being together? Just like we reveal,we open up,we share.** we also need to get and make active effort to get to know our partner,to know what their favorite wine is, what their favorite flowers are; **where they like to be tickled,where they like to be touched;what are their fears,what are their desires; when is it a good time to maybe give their own space, when is it a good time to talk to them, when is it a good time to touch them. And all these things take time.** (**一段健康的恋情需要我们表达自己，而非长期抑制自己，这就是被了解与被认可的区别，被了解是要表达自己，被认可则是要取悦别人。** 这样做是有缺点，敞开心扉表达自己风险更高，因为若她不喜欢这样的我怎么办?如果他深入了解我后，不喜欢我怎么办?但是要知道当我们表达自己时，我们更可能收获一段美好的恋情，但是没什么可以保证一定就有好恋情，这无法保证的，然而若我们一味抑制自己，失败是肯定的。原因如下：首先，当我们逐渐敞开心扉，也许短时间内没有效果，但是，随着时间的流逝，人们会被我们吸引，特别是我的伴侣会逐渐更喜欢我，因为我们有了深层次的亲密关系，即便有时他们对于刚了解的、关于我们的事不是很喜欢或赞赏，**但久而久之，真诚的人，会吸引到其他人，**而且，这种方法也适用于人际关系领域、它适用于友情、适用于提高领导能力，像Peter Drucker阐述的那样，**最伟大的领导不是最有魅力的，也不是最迷人的那些人，而是极其诚实正直的人，这样的领导，他的属下会长久追随他。** **第二件应该时刻谨记的是，如果我给人留下了一个很好的印象，使得这个人，或者这群人都很喜欢我，这奏效了，我成功了，可这是真的吗？他们喜欢的是谁呢？他们喜欢的是我还是那个形象，是我塑造的那个戴着面具的人吗？换言之，他们喜欢的不是真正的我，也许看起来是，但那不是真的，这喜欢是假象，换言之，我失败了，而且这种假象也维持不了太久。** **所以说坦诚相待更可能持久，而当我们的目标是给人留下一个好印象时，这种情形持久的可能性为零。**这并不是要你在第一次约会就放弃尝试给对方留下深刻印象，然而，**共同生活最重要的动因是什么？就像我们前面说的那样，敞开心扉。**我们还需要积极努力，去了解我们的伴侣，去了解他们爱喝的红酒，喜欢的花，**他们喜欢哪里被咯吱、哪里喜欢被触碰。他们怕什么，渴望什么。什么时候该给他们一些独处的空间，什么时候该和他们沟通，什么时候该触碰他们，所有这些都需要时间。**)
3. David Schnarch:" **Intimacy is about letting yourself really be known, including parts that you or your partner don't like.** But it's not just about letting 'warts' be known. It often involves showing strengths you've been hiding,too.
Most approaches focus on getting your partner's validation and acceptance when you disclose. But you can't count on this,and if you try, it inherently limits self-disclosure because you won't say things your partner won't validate. **Resolving gridlock requires intimacy based on validating yourself."** Many,if not most,couples counselors,sex therapists believe that the most important thing in a relationship, in a healthy long relationship is that the partners validate one another. And that is important. **Of course I want to be validated by my partner. Of course I validate my partner. However,that's not the foundation of a healthy relationship. And this is where most therapists, most couples are and this is where I was wrong- not understanding the foundation is to be known,** whether it's in a romantic relationship or a relationship with friends. You see when you disclose,when you disclose, you are taking a risk. And very often, it leads to a conflict,a disagreement,disease in a relationship However. usually,not always, but usually-that is a temporary disease. On the other hand, if you disclose over time and you open up and you share, that's when you lead to long lasting, positive consequences to the relationship. **So on the one hand,when you disclose, it's uncomfortable by definition. If it's comfortable,then it wouldn't be hard, wouldn't be real disclose. It's difficult in the short term, but in a long term,it leads to growth. So the question is what do you want?** (David Schnarch：“**亲密就是让你自己被真正的了解，即使是你或你伴侣不喜欢的也要被了解，**但这并不代表坦露的都是缺点，有时也会是一直没发现的优点，大部分方法，都专注于让你的伴侣，在你坦露时，认同和接受你，但你不能寄希望于此，如果你心存这样的意图，那么你坦露心声时必然有所掣肘，因你只会说那些让你的伴侣认可的话，**打破僵局需要亲密关系，这基于认可你自己。**”大多数婚姻咨询师、性治疗师认为，一段恋情中最重要的、一段健康长久的恋情中最重要的是伴侣间彼此认可，这很重要，**我当然想被对方认可，我当然认可我的伴侣，然而这不是健康恋情的基础，而这是很多治疗师，很多夫妻以及我曾犯过的错误，没有认识到被了解才是基础，**无论是在一段恋情中，还是与朋友的友情中，当你坦露心声时，你是冒着风险的，而且很多时候这会引发冲突、破坏感情，然而通常、几率不是特别高，但通常，这只是短暂的破坏。另一方面，若你长期坦诚，敞开胸怀，这会引领你走向长久的感情，对恋情是有积极效果的。**一方面来看，你坦诚时，肯定会觉得不舒服，舒服的话也就不难了，也就不算真正的坦诚，短期来看这是很难的，但从长远看，它能助长感情。关键在于你想要什么?**

4. The second thing about trying to impress constantly is if we put on a facade and act and then I tried- tried- if I want to be validated constantly,to seem perfect so that the students really like me and approve of me. But then what I'm doing is that I'm hurting the students as well. **Because if I'm good at it, if I'm good at putting on a facade and depicting this perfect teacher, I'm being a terrible role model, which in the long term will only hurt the students. Because that thing doesn't exist. And if anyone is inspired to this perfection, whether in a relationship,whether on the individual level, it is inevitably a prescription for perfectionism hence for failure,hence for unhappiness.** Or if I'm here to be known, which means my weaknesses,my failures- whether it's my failure in Cambridge,my failure here, whether it's the anxiety,then you'll see a real person- whether it's the mistakes,you'll see a real person. And that's a much better teacher, much more accessible I hope than the fa?ade, perfect to thereabout to be validated. And again,beyond the fact,it is so much fun for me being here. Because what I'm doing now is sharing with you. I'm sharing my part of self with you. And I'm sharing the field that I'm so passionate about and care about so much. To be known,to be known rather than to be validated. Easier said than done. But the benefits,especially the long term benefits are immense. Absolutely immense.(长期想取悦别人的缺点是，若我们带着面具，且不断不断地试着让自己被认可、看起来很完美，以便让学生喜欢我认可我，但这样做的同时也伤害到了学生，**因为若我擅于演戏伪装，扮演一个完美老师的角色，我就变成一个很差劲的榜样，** **久而久之会伤害到学生，因为那个完美的我并不存在，如果有人想向这个完美的形象看齐，无论是感情中还是在个人问题上，都不可避免地通往完美主义，也是通往失败与不幸，**除非我是想被了解，也就是说我的缺点、我的失败之处，不管是在剑桥还是在哈佛的失败，或是我的焦虑，你们会见到真实的我，或是犯错误，你们见到的是真实的我，这样的我是一个更好的老师，相较于那个完美形象、更平易近人，好过那个被认可的我。除此以外，这样的我也更快乐，因为我在这里与你们分享，我在分享自己的一部分内心世界，我与大家分享的，是我非常喜欢和关心的，被了解而非被认可，说起容易做来难，但是利大于弊，尤其是长远来看，好处远远大于弊处。)
5.  **The third point is about allowing for conflict in a relationship.** John Gottman has done a lot of work in this area. One of the things that he showed was that **there is not one right relationship. And that also means different relationships look differently from outside or from the inside. Some relationships thrive and they are very quiet. Some relationships thrive and are extremely volatile. Both can succeed.** There is no one right form of relationship. There are numerous permutations and variations on this. **But there is one right relationship, one thing that John Gottman has found is that in all those relationships- whether they are volatile or very peaceful and quiet, or somewhere in between,they all have conflicts. and on average they have 1 conflict for each 5 positive interactions.** (**第三点是要允许恋情中出现冲突。** John Gottman曾对此做过很多研究，他得出的结论之一是：**不存在所谓唯一的标准恋情，这也意味着每段恋情看起来都不同，无论外人看来还是自己看。有一些恋情美好而安宁，有一些恋情则美好却激烈
，两种都可持续下去。**恋情没有统一的正确形式，恋情可以有无数种模式及不同之处，**但健康恋情都有一个共同之处，Gottman发现的一个共同之处，那就是在所有的恋情中，无论是激烈的还是非常平和安宁的，或是两者兼之的恋情，都有争执，平均来看，每5次积极互动就会有一次争执。** )
6. **Allowing for conflict in a relationship. The importance of conflict is that it immunizes us.** If you are not exposed to conflicting relationship, over time,over time the relationship will not strengthen. You'll be weak;it'll be unable to sustain the inevitable conflict that will arise. So conflict immunizes us.It is important. And we'll talk about in what ways or what the conflict looks like
Because not every conflict is healthy. **The key that Gottman talks about is not to take away or eliminate the negative, but rather to accentuate,to strengthen the positive.**So in relationships that don't thrive where there's too much fighting,-relationships that are here. Just accentuate the positive. If you are here and there are no conflicts,well that means maybe we are suppressing things- emotions,disagreements. In other words,we are not being known and we need to move on, and reveal ourselves,open up and share. 

(**亲密关系中允许冲突。冲突的重要性在于它使我们免疫。**如果你的恋情从不发生冲突，久而久之，恋情无法得到巩固加强，你会变得脆弱，当冲突无可避免时，恋情就会难以维持。所以说冲突使我们免疫，这很重要。再谈一下冲突的种类与形式，因为不是每种冲突都有益。**Gottman说过关键不在于消除负面的东西，而是要强调巩固积极的东西。**所以对于那些不成功的恋情，那些经常发生争吵的恋情，像这样的恋情，强调积极方面。而若是处于这种无冲突恋情，很可能你们在压抑、压抑感受、分歧，换言之，我们没被了解，我们需要改进，坦诚、敞开心扉、彼此分享。)
7. **“Gold is in the details.”**  **The same with love.Love is in the details.** Love is not in that one week or two months around the world cruise; love is not in that 5 carat diamond ring. Yes these things are wonderful; they are certainly to a spike in well being, sometimes to a spike in love, but they are not what sustains a happy relationship. **What sustains a happy relationship are the details. The little things. The day to day rituals,the touch,the gaze,the meal together.** **Mini love boosters also sustain.** I got this idea from Peter Fraenkel who is From the Ackerman Family Center in New York. And what he talks about are 30 seconds pleasure points throughout the day, whether it's a passionate kiss, whether it's just a hug where you just hold one another, whether it's just sending a text message to your partner saying how much you love them and miss them- the little things. **And what they found was these little things made the big difference.** Again,yes,the big things also make a difference. I'm not belittling them.But that just leads to a spike. To sustain happiness it takes time,and it takes work. It takes commitment. **A relationship is made extraordinary by focusing on these details on day to day activities.** **And how we do that? We demonstrate interest**, by asking "so how is your day sweetheart", or "tell me more about what you have just done", or "what have you been thinking", 00:48:56,980 --> 00:49:01,540
or you know "you look a little bit down- anything I can do". **Demonstrate interest.Create love maps. Get to know the other person- what they like; what they don't like; and how they like it. Again,the little things such as touching, such as smiling,such as flowers, such as remembering the important dates,men.**(**"上帝就在细节中"**，(爱因斯坦与Ludwig van der Rohe的故事)**爱情也是这样，爱情就在细节中。**爱情不在一周或一个月的环游世界中，爱情不在五克拉的钻戒里，这些东西是很美妙，也确实激发了幸福感，有时甚至激发了爱情，但它们不能维持一段美好的感情，**能够长期维持幸福恋情的是细节，是那些微小的事情，是每天的生活常规，触碰，凝视，共进晚餐。****迷你爱情助力器也能维持。**这是我从Peter Fraenkel学来的，他是纽约Ackerman家庭服务中心的，他讲的是一天里的30秒钟的幸福点，无论是一个激吻，或只是一个单纯的拥抱，或是发给伴侣的一条短信，告诉他们你有多爱他们多想他们这类小事，**他们发现，正是这些小事产生重大影响**，当然，大事也能产生影响，我不是贬低大事，但那只能导致激变，而**维持幸福需要长久的努力，需要奉献，感情的维系主要是靠注重这些日常琐碎的小事。****我们怎么做到呢？ 我们表现出我们的关心**，我们问"你今天过得怎样？" 或"讲讲你刚做了什么？"或"你在想什么？"或"你不太高兴啊，我能做什么？"**表现出关心，画爱情地图，去了解对方，，他喜欢什么，不喜欢什么，有多喜欢，就是那些小事，比如触碰、微笑、送花，记得重要的日子。**)
8. Finally,**sex is important for long term thriving relationship.** It does not have to come before marriage; does not have to come before there is a life long commitment-marriage or other. It can; it often does in our world. And either way is fine- either choice. **However,for the long term success of the relationship, it is also important to have the physical aspect.** **Cause that's one of the distinguishing characteristics between that and a deep friendship,for example. Love at its- or rather sex at its highest is love made concrete. Love made concrete. That is why we talk about making love.** It's the concretization of the emotion,of that abstract notion. **The important thing here is, as every other areas of the relationship,healthy communication. Because very often we reveal ourselves,we share of ourselves in the bedroom more than in any other place, whether it's physically or emotionally or cognitively. That's where we open up. That's when we are literally metaphorically naked. And communication is important.** (最后，**性在长久美好恋情中很重要**，性不一定要在婚前发生，或者等到彼此承诺厮守一生才发生性关系，这厮守可以是结婚也可以不是，可以是婚姻--在现实生活中也经常是婚姻，是不是结婚都行，**然而，对于长期恋情的成功延续，生理方面也很重要。生理因素是区分爱与深厚友情的一个显著特征，爱情，准确地说，性的至高点使爱具体化，使爱具体化，这也是为什么我们会说做爱。**，它是感情、是抽象的爱的具体化，**生理方面很重要的一点是，健康的交流，就像别的感情一样，因为我们经常坦露自己，分享自己，在卧室远多过在其他地方，无论是肉体上，还是情感上，还是认知上，那是我们敞开心怀的地方，那是我们真正赤裸相对的地方，交流是很重要的。**)
9. **Not any conflict is good.** There is positive as well as negative conflict. what research in organizational behavior shows is that **healthy inter-group or intra-group conflict is cognitive conflict rather than affective conflict.** Cognitive conflict is about focusing on the person's behavior, or thoughts and ideas,and challenging those. Unhealthy conflict is focusing on the person,on the emotions, on who they are. And when I attack someone for who they are- the person,the emotion,that is not healthy- not for a group,not for couples. At the same time, I can disagree with,can have conflict when it comes, when we focus on the ideas,the thought and the behavior.(**不是所有的冲突都是好的**，冲突有积极的有消极的。组织行为研究表明，**健康的组织内或组织外冲突，是认知冲突，而非情感冲突**，认知冲突针对人的行为或思想、观念、对这些提出质疑，不健康的冲突注重于人、情感、他们自身，而当我攻击某人自身，那个人本身及情感时，这是不健康的，无论是组织还是夫妻，与此同时，当针对观念、想法、行为时，我可以不赞同，可以发生争执。)
10. **It is important to avoid hostility,insult and contempt. to focus on the person,to validate the person, to appreciate the person,and then to disagree with the behavior, or with the ideas and the thinking.** (**尽量避免恶意、侮辱及蔑视，避免针对人身。认可本人，尽量赞赏对方，仅对其行为或是其想法观念不苟同。**)
11. **The key is to keep these disputes private**, meaning: it is difficult enough to fight in a relationship; it is extraordinary difficult when embarrassment is also associated with it. So couples who shout at one another when there are others. That is extremely destructive,extremely unhelpful. So to keep these intimate moments that can potentially lead to growth private.还有很关键的一点是**私下才争吵。**意思是说，本来恋情中的争吵就很不好，若是再引来尴尬羞愧就更糟糕了。所以夫妻在有外人时吼叫对方，或者有朋友在场时轻视对方，这是非常具有破坏力的，极其危险的。所以让争吵私下化，能潜在的让私密关系好起来。
12. some tips for dissolve。(有分歧时，一些建议。)
	* More positive, more humor, more affection, more touching, that helps to dissolve, to relax some of the tension that exists. **The negativity is less often taken personally.** (更积极、更幽默、更多爱意与触碰，这对解决分歧很有帮助，能够缓解紧张的气氛。**人身攻击的情况较少**。)
	* **More attention to the other side, to calm down,to understand,to be empathic,** whether it's men or women. To be empathic and understand and soothe. And very often,just in a middle of conflict, saying something like,you know "I'm sorry" or just a hug. Or you know "it hurts me and I love you so much". Just ways of soothing,(最后，**要多关心对方，冷静下来，理解对方的感受**，无论男女，要设身处地理解对方，让对方平静下来。通常，就在争执中说一些"我很抱歉"，或是一个拥抱，或"我很受伤也很爱你"，这些方法都能让对方平静下来，减缓冲突带来的压力。)
13. Rules:
	* golden rule: do not do unto others what you would not have done unto yourself.(黄金法则：己所不欲，勿施于人。)
	* platinum rule: do not do unto yourself what you would not do unto others.(白金法则: 人所不欲，勿施于自。)
	* **Titanium rule: do not do unto those close to you what you would not have done unto others who are not so close to you.**(**钛规则: 你不会对泛泛之交做的事,也千万不要对你亲密的人做.**(不要对亲密的人刻薄，而对陌生人友好))
14. John Gottman: "At the heart of my program is the simple truth **that happy marriages are based on a deep friendship.** By this I mean a mutual respect for 
and enjoyment of each other's company. These couples tend to know each other intimately―they are well versed in each other's likes,dislikes, personality quirks,hopes,and dreams. They have an abiding regard for each other and express this fondness not just in the big ways, but in little ways day in and day out."(John Gottman：“我的方法的核心是一个简单的真理，**即幸福的婚姻基于深厚的友情之上。**这句话意味尊重对方，享受与对方的相处，这些情侣能深入了解对方，他们熟知对方的喜恶、性格怪癖、理想与梦想，他们对彼此有着持久的尊敬，不仅在大的问题上表达喜爱之情，也在日常琐碎间表达出来。”)
15. **Benefit finding**：To focus on the discipline of my partner rather than on the rigidity. To focus on their sense of humor rather than look at it as frivolous. **Focusing on the good; focusing on what works. And that is then accentuated.**(**优点感知**：欣赏伴侣的自律，而不是把自律看成固执；欣赏伴侣的幽默感，而不是把幽默看成耍滑头，**把注意力放在优点上，放在顺利的地方上，这些优点就会加强**。)
16. **Benefit creating:** However successful thriving couples take this step further. They are not just benefit finders; they have what Sandra Murray calls,positive illusions. **In other words, they think of their partner more than other people think of them. So the experiment that Sandra Murray did shows Couples who evaluated each other at a higher level, meaning as better than friends evaluated them, as better than family evaluated them, these couples' relationships were most likely to thrive and succeed over time.** And Sandra Murray called it- because they were not connected to the evaluation of other people, Sandra Murray called it "positive illusions". Now I agree partially with Sandra Murray. I agree with her that it is important to have these high, more positive evaluations. The one thing that I disagree with Murray is on the use of the word illusion. **Because I don't think that is an illusion. In fact,it is very real. It is very real because it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.** And here I'm introducing a new term in addition to benefit finding,benefit creating. Seeing things that were not there or the other people had not seen and then making it real.(**优点创造：**然而成功的幸福伴侣做得更好，他们不仅是优点感知者，他们还有Sandra Murray所说的积极错觉，**换言之，他们认为伴侣要比别人眼中还要好。Sandra Murray做的实验显示情侣间对对方的评价要高于其朋友或家人给予的评价的情侣，这些情侣的恋情最可能，持续且美好下去，** 这部分人 Sandra Murray将其称为，因为他们对彼此的评价与外界不符，Sandra Murray将其称为"积极错觉"，或按Brad Little的说法是，他们有着"虚幻的光辉"，认为彼此远比实际上要好。我(tal)部分同意Sandra Murray的观点，我同意她说的，对伴侣有积极的评价是很重要的，**但我不同意她的是对于错觉这一词汇的运用，因为我认为这不是错觉，事实上 这是真实的，因为这成为一个自我实现的预言，**在这里我引进一个新的术语，**除了优点感知，还有优点创造，看到不存在的优点，或是别人没看到的优点并让其成为现实。**)

# Lesson 20. Happiness and humor.(幸福与幽默)
1. **Now what we realized is that this tender age of just 7 and 5 years old with something that is going to be the heart as the vanguard of the positive psychology revolution**, that we've been talking about, about how our brain is basically a single processor, capable of consciously choosing to devote resources either to the pain and suffering on one side, or viewing the world that lens of something like optimism or mindfulness. So too I think humor is exactly in this the facet.(我们从中发现，**5到7岁这个脆弱的年龄，带有一些特征，这些特征将会成为幸福心理学革命的核心**，这个我们已经讲过了，我们讲过我们的大脑就像一个单一处理器，能够有意识地选择把精力放在痛苦和折磨上，或者把精力用来用乐观和正念的眼光 来看这个世界，所以我觉得幽默也正是这样)
2. **I think that humor itself is the option**, the mindful option of choosing between viewing the world through the lens of being,of suffering,of optimism- suffering,not optimism,suffering,of pain,of injustice, or viewing the world through the lens of something of adaptive and powerful.(**我认为幽默本身就是一种选择**，有意地去选择，怎样来看待世界，是用痛苦、折磨、不公的眼光来看这个世界，还是用一种适应性的强有力的眼光来看。)
3. Part of what we are seeing here is that **once we are tempted to define something, once we attempt to define what makes something humorous, it immediately seems to go away.** **This is the Dead Frog Problem. The Dead Frog Problem is that the more you seem to dissect the frog,the faster it seems to die.**(一旦我们尝试去定义某些东西，一旦我们试图定义是什么让一些事情变得幽默时，这些事情马上就不幽默了。这是一个**死青蛙问题。死青蛙问题就是说，你越是解剖一只青蛙，它死得就越快。**)
4. Jokes and Their Relationship to the Unconscious - he(Sigmund Freud) describes this model consciousness while the inside you have the **id** - the id contains the sexual and the physical and the violent impulses that we all have. Outside of that is the **ego** which makes the decisions about the id as the permeable barrier between the id impulses and the society. And the outside layer is **super-ego** The super-ego is the moral constraints, the societal constraints that is placed upon us. So for example,if my id impulse make, means that I'm angry at you,and I want to punch you, my super-ego,the constraints of society prevent me from doing so.(《笑话及其与潜意识的关系》一书中，他（弗洛伊德）描述了一种典范意识，在我们内心有一个**本我**，这个本我包括了大家都有的性欲、生命力、和冲动，本我之外是**自我**，这个自我会把本我视为本我冲动和社会之间一道可渗透的屏障，最外面的是**超我**，超我是加在我们身上的，道德约束和社会约束，例如：如果我的本我冲动，说我很生气，我想揍你，我的超我，那个道德约束就会阻止我打你。)
5. And so one of the things that we find is that Freud argues we get frustrated. **We get frustrated because those id impulses are there.** but we have no way of getting those impulses out into the world. And so we become repressed. And more you become repressed, I think something's about exploding in the end. So there's something that's really bad about that. So what he says is that humor is a socially acceptable envelope for couching those id desires. It's a way, a socially acceptable way of getting those id impulses out into society, **which explains why so much of our humor is sexual or aggressive in nature.** (我们发现弗洛伊德说的是：**“我们都会受挫。“因为我们都有本我冲动**，但我们没办法把这些冲动释放出来，所以我们就会被压抑，你越压抑，最终就会爆发，所以压抑会带来严重后果，他认为：幽默是一种社会可接受的、用来疏导这些欲望的信封，这是一种社会可接受的、把本我冲动释放出来的方法，**这就解释了为什么我们很多幽默本质上都是与性和攻击有关的。**)
6. we've **looked at humor as a corrective**, and we **looked humor as a psychology release.** (我们讲了**幽默是一种纠正器**，我们讲了**幽默是一种心理释放**。)
7. Part of what we are seeing here is that -**absolutely is the mindset that dictates whether or not something is going to be funny.** And if it's mindset,it's within our control. And today we are going to talk about some of the ways you can actually control that.(我们从中发现，**我们有一个心态，决定什么是好笑的、什么是不好笑的**，如果这真的是由心态决定，那我们就可以控制它。今天我们就讲几个控制这个心态的方法。)
8.  cognitive afterimage：(认知残像)
9. Peter Berger argues that **when we laugh at something, we get a momentary, a momentary suspension of reality -that when we can see something that is alternative to reality, it teaches us that the status quo, the reality that we are seeing in front of us is both malleable and is not the only possible reality, that the status quo absolutely can be changed. So humor provides a way of being actually more mindful.** Ellen Langer **defines mindfulness as "being present in the situation", so that you can be aware of the potentials in that environment.**(Peter Berger认为，**当我们笑某件事时，我们会暂时性地暂时地中止了现实，我们能看到一些有别于现实的东西，它让我们知道，我们眼前的现实是可塑的，它不是唯一一种可能的现实，现状是可以改变的，所以幽默可以使我们变得更正念。** Ellen Langer把**正念定义为"留心眼前的情景"，这样你就能留意到环境中的可能性。**)
10. humor will do something like this at the chemical level -that it actually increases our T-cells in our body which actually strengthen our immune system; increasing our Gamma-interferon, which is the disease fighting protein as well as increasing our B-cells which are responsible for creating antibodies to actually prepare our body to defend against disease. The humor is actually making us better defended against reality,(幽默还能够在化学层面上起作用:它能增加我们体内的T细胞，从而加强我们的免疫系统；增加我们的γ-干扰素，它是一种抵抗疾病的蛋白质，还会增加我们的B细胞，B细胞负责生成抗体，加强我们身体抵抗疾病的能力，所以幽默真的能帮我们更好地对抗现实。)
11. **Laughter decreases the amount of serum cortisol that occurs in our body.** **Cortisol is released when we have a stress response.** That stress response if I cause you to be stressful for whatever reason, and your cortisol levels begin to go up; **if you cause somebody to laugh midway during that experience, their cortisol levels actually decrease again;** that if they are going through a stressful event, laughing in the midst and going through that event will actually allow them to not have all the negative effects of stress.(**笑能降低我们体内的血清皮质醇，** **当我们感受到压力时 就会释放皮质醇，应激反应**，如果我做了某些事让你感到有压力了，你的皮质醇水平就会上升，**如果你在这时候引人发笑，他们的皮质醇水平就会降低，**也就是说在他们感受到压力时大笑起来，在压力中笑起来，能够使他们降低压力带来的消积影响。)
12. **Humor also increases pain tolerance.** this has a lot to do and a lot of implications thus for people that are experiencing chronic fatigue or chronic pain in their own lives due to diseases, and the way which humor itself could play a role in that. They also found that after you eat a large meal, that if you have type 2 diabetes and you eat a large meal, that if you are watching something that's humorous afterwards as opposed to something that's neutral surprisingly your blood sugar actually was much lower than the group that have eaten the same exactly meal, which is amazing that it's occurring.(**幽默能提高忍痛度**，这个结果给了人们很多启示：那些日常生活中因为患有疾病而有慢性疲劳或者慢性痛的人，幽默可以减轻他们的疲劳或疼痛。他们还发现如果你有II型糖尿病，而你狂吃了一顿，如果你吃完后，看了一些好笑的东西，而不是一些平平淡淡的东西，令人惊讶地，你的血糖会比那些吃了同样多的人低很多，这种效果太惊人了。)
13. **Now the reason why this is helpful is because of the attraction that it causes in these first situations.** So what they found is they bring in strangers, have them play a competitive game. Afterwards you have them rank the attractiveness and how closely they feel bonded to the person they are working with. And usually the levels of attraction and bondage were pretty low. For the middle group, you have somebody come in and you have them do a cooperative task This is similar to the Wall Street and community games studies that Tal was talking about earlier on this semester. And this experiment - when you have a cooperative task, people's attractiveness,the ratings of attraction and bondage for both of the individuals go up. But if you have that individual do an extremely awkward task together, like play Twister, or you have somebody come into the room that this experimenters are in, and ask them accidently pour water on one of the participants, telling them that they are awkward and leaving the room, allowing them to laugh about it,those individuals - **because there is something humorous that is going on - showed the highest ratings of other persons being attractive, and showed the highest levels of bondage.**(**幽默之所以能帮助我们的社交，是因为第一次相遇时，它能制造吸引力。**他们发现，他们找来互不认识的参与者，让他们玩一个竞赛游戏，之后让他们评价对方的吸引力以及他们对比赛对手产生了多少感情，通常他们的吸引力和感情都很低。中间那组：你找人来合作完成一个任务，跟Tal这个学期讲过的华尔街和社区运动会的研究很相似，在这个实验里，如果是合作完成任务，参与者的吸引力、两个人的吸引力和感情都上升了。但如果你让参与者做一件很尴尬的事，例如玩扭扭乐，或者让人走进房间，实验参与者所在的房间，叫他们不小心地把水倒到其中一个参与者身上，告诉他们，他们笨手笨脚的，然后离开房间，让他们笑这件事、这些人，**因为这个过程中发生了幽默的事，所以给对方评的吸引力分数是最高的，而且感情也是最深的。**)
14. part of what scientists and psychologists believe is that **humor is a signal of cognitive fitness, that just like we want physical fitness in somebody else, so too we want cognitive fitness. We want somebody humorous to view the world from different lenses It actually has a dramatic effect upon not only the way that they can deal with reality but the way they can help you deal with reality.**(科学家和心理学家认为：**幽默是表示认知能力良好的一个信号，就像我们喜欢别人有良好的体格一样，我们也喜欢良好的认知能力，我们喜欢能用不同视角看世界的幽默之人，它不仅能极大地影响他们看待世界的方式，还会影响他们帮助你应付现实的方式。**)
15. Bressler found that the number of laughs by the female correlated with how much the female like the male and that in exchange. They also found out that the number of laughs by the female correlated with how much the male liked her. What they found is the male's laughter had absolutely no effect whatsoever upon the attractiveness of either people.(Bressler发现女人笑的次数，与女人喜欢男人的的程度成正比，反过来也是，他们还发现，女人笑的次数与男人喜欢她的程度成正比，他们还发现，男人的笑对两个人的吸引力都没有任何影响。)

# Lesson 21. Love And Self-esteem(爱情与自尊)
1. Ralph Waldo Emerson:**"In a friend, what I am looking for is not a mush of concessions, a person who would agree with everything that I say; rather what I am looking for is a beautiful enemy, a person who will challenge me, who will push me, who will help me in my apprenticeship to the truth."**(艾默生《论友谊》：**“在朋友(爱人)身上，我寻找的不是盲目的让步，对我百依百顺的人，我寻找的是一个美丽的敌人，一个能挑战我、督促我、帮助我寻求真相的人。”**)
2. You make me want to be a better man.(你使我想成为更好的男人。)
3. Active constructive responding actually elongates that raising, that improvement in well being. (积极且有建设性的回应会延长幸福感的提升和增强。)
4. **Should we even talk about relationships in the context of pursuit of happiness?** and the answer for most people is yes with some discomfort. yes, because it is the No.1 generator of the ultimate currency; some discomfort because pursuing happiness is by its nature selfish. Imean actually when I am thinking about my happiness, I'm thinking by definition about the self. and **shouldn't relationship be about the opposite of selfshness? In other words, about altruism.** think above: which partner would you rather have? a partner who is with you just because they feel like:"well, that person really needs me, or I feel sorry for the person, I don't really like that person, but I'm there just to be there for them, because, out of a sense of duty?" or would you rather have a person who is with you because you are the most important person in their lives, because they care about so much that the I becomes the We? they care about you as much as the care about themselves. they include you in their circle of the self." that does not mean that there is no sacrificing in relationships; that does not mean that if my partner is unwell, or needs my help, I would not go out of my way, even if it means giving up something that I really really want to do at that point. of course, in healthy relationships, **when the I is become a We, sacrifices exist. and there is healthy sacrifice. but  it's not a relationship that is based fundamentally on the sense of duty, or altruistic negation of the self.** Nathaniel Branden:" **The more independent we are, The more inter-dependent we can become."**(**我们是否应该在追求幸福的背景下谈论恋情？** 大多数人的回答是：是的，但有所保留。说“是”的原因是因为爱情是幸福的最重要来源; 有所保留的原因是追求幸福的本质是自私的。我的意思是，我思考我的幸福时，毫无疑问，我想的是自己。**难道恋情不是与自私对立的吗？换句话说，恋情是利他主义的。**考虑一下下面两种恋人，你会选择哪个：一个跟你在一起是因为他们觉得：“这人很需要我，这家伙真可怜，我不是真的喜欢他，我只是出于责任感，支持他”的人？还是跟你在一起是因为你是他们生命中最重要的人，因为他们如此关心你，从“我”变成了“我们”，他们像关心自己一样关心你，他们把你纳入自己的一部分？这不是说爱情中不会有牺牲，也不是说，如果我伴侣身体不适，或者需要我帮助，我不会全力以赴，即使那以为着需要放弃我当时的梦想，当然了，**在健康的恋情中，当”我“变成了”我们”，就会有牺牲，但这是健康的牺牲，这样的恋情，他的基础不是责任感，不是否定自我的利他主义。** Nathaniel Branden说过：“**我们越独立，我们就越能相互依赖**”
## self-esteem(自尊)
5. what is **self-esteem**:
**the disposition to experience oneself as competent to cope with the basic challenges of life and as worthy of happiness.** Two components- **the feeling and experience of competence**, and **the feeling and experience of worthiness.** (**一种觉得自己能够应付生活中的基本挑战，值得享受快乐的感觉。**两个组成部分：**能力感**和**价值感**。)
6. Goethe said "**The greatest evil that can befall man is that he should come to think ill of himself.**"(歌德说过：“**降临于人最大的邪恶是让他否认自己。**”)

7. **self concept is destiny.** It applies to our top performance; It applies to our worst performance as well.(**自我概念即命运。**它是我们取得最高效率的原因，也是我们取得最差表现的原因。)
8. Nathaniel Branden **calls self-esteem "the immune system of consciousness."** when we have high self-esteem, it means we are more resilient psychologically. Remember, a strong immune system dose not mean we don't get sick. It means we get sick but less often, and when we do get sick, we recover more promptly.(Nathaniel Branden 把自尊称为 "**意识的免疫系统**"，我们自尊较高时，心理抵抗能力更强，记住，强健的免疫系统并不意味着不会生病，而是较少得病，如果生病了，也能更迅速地恢复。)
9.  Rollo May:"**The person who feels weak becomes a bully, the inferior person a braggart; a flexing of muscles,much talk,cockiness, an endeavor to brazen it out, are symptoms of covert anxiety in a person or a group.**"(Rollo May：“**软弱的人变成恶霸，自卑的人变成吹牛大王，炫耀武力、夸夸其谈、骄傲自大、厚颜无耻，都是个人或集体隐匿的焦虑症状。**”)
10. how do we salvage self-esteem's self-esteem?(如何拯救自尊?)
* By understanding its true nature. First of all, **self-esteem is not a product of empty reinforcement.** Oh you are wonderful;you are terrific; you are great - no matter what. That hurts self-esteem in the long term. **Self-esteem has to be distinguished from pseudo self-esteem once again the pretense of self-efficacy and self-respect without the reality.** That's not self-esteem; that's narcissism; that's detachment from reality. And as we've been talking about constantly, psychological healthy is a function of connection to reality. So what is self-esteem? **Self-esteem is founded in reality, in actual performance, in actual success, in actual practices.** **It is a product of hard work.** OK,do you remember the secret of success from 2 months ago? Optimism, belief in oneself, passion for what one is doing, **and finally, hard work. That's secret**.(需要先理解它的真实性质，首先，**自尊不是空洞的心理强化能够产生的。**哦！你真棒！你好厉害！你真行！不管是不是都赞扬，长期来看还会损害自尊。**自尊必须与伪自尊区分开，也就是脱离现实的，虚假的自我效能与自我尊重。**那些不是自尊，那是自恋，脱离现实。我们最近反复提到，健康心理是要联系现实。所以什么是自尊呢，**自尊存在于现实中，存在于真实的行动、真实的成功、与真实的实践中**，**它是努力的产物。** 好了，还记得2个月前我们讲到的成功的秘诀吗? 乐观――相信自己，对所做之事充满热情， **最后一点，努力奋斗（自尊），这就是秘诀。**)
11. Nathaniel Branden talks about **6 practices that are important for the cultivation of self-esteem**:(Nathaniel Branden提出了**培养自尊的6条重要实践**)
* first, **integrity. And integrity means a match between what we say and what we do**, the little things and the big things, whether it's "I'll be there at 5 minutes after 5", being there at 5 minutes after 5; saying that "I'm going to work out this week", and actually doing it. Because you see,when we communicate,when we utter words, and we don't follow up on what we say, what we are essentially communicating to ourselves: what I say is not important; it doesn't matter. Whereas I maintain high levels of integrity, when I keep my words - again no one is perfect. No one has perfect integrity as we'll talk about next time. But when I genuinely keep my word, when I follow up on what I say, when I under-promise and over-deliver, that's when I communicate to myself in action remember,self-perception theory - in action, I communicate to myself,"My words matter; I matter." So the practice of integrity. The practice of self-awareness - know thyself. Self-consciousness,as Branden talks about.(首先，**要正直，正直是指言行一致。** 小事大事，无论是"我5点过5分到"，那就5点过5分到；还是"我这周去健身"，那就要做到。**因为我们沟通，说出每个词时，如果言行不一致，那我们本质是在对自己说，我的话无关紧要，不重要。** **反之，我保持高度正直、遵守诺言――当然没人是完美的，没人会是100%的正直，我们下次会讲到。但是我真诚的遵守诺言、言行一致，以低要求许诺，以高要求履诺，就是以行动对自己说，还记得 自我知觉理论吗，通过行动，我对自己说 "我的话很重要，我很重要。"** 所以要正直。)
* **The practice of self-awareness - know thyself**. **Self-consciousness**, as Branden talks about.(要有**自我察觉的意识―**―了解你自己。也就是Branden说的**自我意识**。)
* **Purpose fulness, having goals, having self-concordant goals, pursuing them, living a life of purpose, of calling, pursuing them, living a life of purpose,of calling,** It's up to you to make something of your lives.(**目的性**，有目标，自我协调的目标，**努力追求、有目标有使命地生活**，担起责任，记住，没人能帮你，只有靠你自己创造生活。)
* **The practice of self-acceptance.** **Permission to be human** on a daily basis.(**要自我接纳。**每天都要**允许自己有人的天性**。)

* And finally, **the practice of self-assertiveness**: to say no when it's appropriate; to say yes when that is appropriate; to stand up for what we believe in.(最后，**要有主见**：该说不的时候说不，该说是的时候说是，**支持我们信仰的东西。**)


12. three levels of self-esteem：(自尊的三个层次)
* dependence self-esteem(依赖性自尊)
	self-esteem that is generated by others' praise or approval.(由他人表扬和认同而产生的自尊。)
* independece self-esteem(独立自尊)
	self-esteem that comes from within. self-esteem that is not contingent on other people, say, self generated(内在产生的自尊，这种自尊不取决于别人的评价，是自我生成的)
* unconditional self-esteem(无条件的自尊)
	a stage of being, where we simply and naturally exist. (也可称作一种自然状态，我们自然的存在感)

13. dependence self-esteem(依赖性自尊)
* **In terms of worthiness:** **a person who has high dependent self-esteem is other determined. They enjoy and they need the appraisal.** If I do well in a lecture, and I get an external feedback that makes me great; if I don't get great feedback,I feel awful. If I do well on an exams, I get good feedback from my TF or parents,I feel terrific. If someone tells me that they don't like something that I said, I feel awful. **My life is constantly affected by what other people think or say, or what I think that they think,or what I think that they mean. Constant evaluation - what do other people think of me? Like a looking glass - looking at other people as it reflects on me and taking their evaluation as the sense of self that I have.** People who have high dependent self-esteem are primarily, not only, but primarily motivated by what other people think and say. **I will choose a job that will yield the most prestige, the highest social status, that will yield the most accolades and praise.** I will choose a partner who I think most other people would approve of and like. Again, **the sense of self - contingent on other people; then important decision are made based on other people's approval or disapproval.** (**价值感：****高依赖型自尊的人，价值由他人决定。他们喜欢、也需要别人的评估。**如果我讲座表现不错，收到他人反馈让我感觉良好，如果没得到正面反馈，我会感觉很糟糕。如果我考试表现优异，得到助教或家长肯定，就感觉棒极了，如果有人说不喜欢我的某些言论，我会感觉糟透了。**我的生活不断受到他人思想言论的影响，甚至是我以为他们怎么想、他们的意思，不断的评估，其他人是怎么看我的，仿佛他们是一面镜子，仿佛从他们身上能看到镜中的自己一样，把他们的评估当作自我感。** 高依赖型自尊的人主要，不是全部，但主要是由他人的想法言论驱动的，**我会从事高声望、高社会地位的工作，能给我带来最多的赞赏与表扬，**我选择伴侣，会选择受大多数人喜爱的人，**他们的自我感取决于他人，重要的决定，都是根据别人的赞同或不赞同而做出的。**)

* **sense of competence: The second component of self-esteem according to Branden comes through other comparison.** How am I doing relative to other people? If I do better than others on the test,I feel great; **if others do better than I do, no matter how objectively good or bad it is, what matters is how I am doing relative to others.** Compared to other people. **In fact most psychologists have talked about self-esteem as dependent self-esteem.**(**能力感：**根据Branden理论，自尊的另一个组成部分，**来源于比较**。跟其他人比，我表现怎么样？如果考试中，我比其他人考得好，我会感觉很好。**如果其他人考得比我好，不管客观来说有多好或多差，重要的是我跟其他人比表现怎么样。**与他人比较，**事实上，大多数心理学家都把自尊，等同于依赖型自尊。**)

**The two components of self-esteem here:** **first of all, the other determined.** I'm asking a mirror to evaluate me,not self-determined. So my worthiness comes from an external source. **And second, competence - I compare myself to others.** Is there anyone who is fairer than I? Dependent self-esteem.(**说明了依赖型自尊的两个特点：** **首先，由他人决定。** 我问镜子谁漂亮，而不是由我自己决定，所以我的**价值感来源于外部**；**第二 通过比较而获得能力感**，有人比我更美吗？依赖型自尊。)

Let me make this very clear. **Everyone has some dependent self-esteem. It's part of human nature.** Nature to be commanded must be obeyed. If we fight it, it will only intensify. and **part of being human is that we all have some dependent self... The question is of degree.** **The important thing to understand about this model, these three levels is that it's an epigenetic model. It is an epigenetic model. Epigenetic is that you first need to get past the first stage in order to get to the second stage; you first need to get past the second stage in order to get to the third stage; that you cannot skip.**(让我再说的清楚点，**每个人都有依赖型自尊，这是人的天性的一部分。**要支配天性，就必须服从天性，反抗天性，只会让其加剧。**依赖型自尊也是人性的一部分，问题在于程度。** **理解这个模型的一个关键是：这三个层面是一个渐成模型。渐成是指必须通过第一阶段，才能到达第二阶段；必须通过第二阶段，才能到达第三阶段，不能越过某一级。**)

14. independece self-esteem(独立自尊)
* **in terms of worthiness:** **I evaluate myself according to my own standards.**
I'm self-determined. I determine how good a book that I wrote is. Ultimately - the ultimate arbiter: **I do take into consideration and listen to what other people are saying; but at the end of the day I'm the one who decides.**(**在价值感方面：** **我用自己的标准评估自己。**自我决定，我自己评定写的书好不好，最终的公断人是我自己，**我会参考和听取其他人的意见。但是最终还是由我自己说了算。**)
* **Competence:** **not comparison to others but comparison to oneself.** Have I improved? Am I better writer today than I was in the past? Do I know more math today than I knew at the beginning of the semester? Am I able to apply more things from positive psychology than I applied initially? Not compared to my roommate who is applying so much more or so much less, but mostly focused on the self. Their motivation, **their primary motivation is "What am I passionate about?" "What do I care about?" "What do I really,really want to do with my life?" They are about pursuing self-concordant goals.**(**在能力感方面：**  **不与别人比较,而是与自己比较。**我进步了吗？是不是比过去写得好了?我的数学是不是比学期初进步了？我是不是比一开始能运用更多的积极心理学知识了？**他们的动力，主要动力是"我热爱什么?" "我喜欢什么?" "我真正想做的是什么" 他们想追求自我调节的目标。**)

14. unconditional self-esteem(无条件的自尊)
* **worthiness:** **not contingent, it's not contingent on other people's evaluations; it's not even contingent on my evaluation. I'm confident enough not to be engaged in evaluations.** (**价值感：** **不取决于他人评价，也不取决于自我评价，我有充分的自信，不参与任何评价。**)
* **In terms of competence:** **it's interdependent. I don't compare myself to how well I am doing relative to others, nor even how well I'm doing relative to myself. I am in a state of being. Interdependence with others - fully comfortable in my own skin.** ( **能力感：**   **互相依赖，不把自己与他人比较，也不与自己比较，我处于某种状态，与他人互相依赖，同时又怡然自得。**)

For example, a person writing a book who has high dependent self-esteem is primarily motivated by the accolades, by the praise she or he will get; a person who has high dependent, or, and also by how well that book is doing relative to other books; a person with independent self-esteem writes a book and derives pleasure and satisfaction from writing better than he or she did in the past,from improving, as well as from self-evaluation of the book: this is good. A person who has unconditional self-esteem simply writes a book. Why? Because he or she once, if they have a good idea,a good book to be out there, they derive as much satisfaction, as much pleasure when they see another person's book,who is good, They are interdependent. They see themselves as one with others.(比如，一个高依赖型自尊的人写书，他的动力主要是将要获得的赞赏和表扬，高依赖型自尊的人还会把他的书与其他人的比较；高独立型人格的人写书，他的快乐与满足的来源是通过改进写得比过去好了，还有对书的自我评价，这本书写得真好，而无条件型自尊的人只是写书，为什么? 因为一旦他们有灵感，就会写出一本好书，他们从他人的好书中，也能获得同样的满足与乐趣。他们互相依靠，他们视自己为团体一员。)
	
8. How we cultivate independent as well as unconditional self-esteem? (如何培养独立自尊及无条件自尊？)
9. How we can enhance our levels of self-esteem.(如何提高自尊水平？)

# Lesson 22. Self-esteem and self-actualized(自尊与自我实现)
1. **When we experience a sense of independent self-esteem We are much calmer when we don't constantly have to prove ourselves to others It is enervating to constantly be on the guard.** Is this person gonna like me? How do I gain their validation? We are much calmer when we say "Let me express myself And yes it may hurt me It will hurt me, if they don't like me That's OK. I'm resilient I'm strong, I can deal." **when we express rather than constantly try to impress, Imagine how much lighter our lives can be.** if, when we are here or when we walk out of here, we experience the sense of being more and more of the time. again, not perfectly, because that's not human, **but more and more of the time to just be, to exist, to celebrate our existence and the existence as a whole.**(**当我们有独立型自尊时，我们的幸福感会更高，我们会更平静，我们不会不停地向别人证明自己，总是处于警惕状态是一件很劳心劳力的事。**这个人会喜欢我吗? 我怎么得到他们的认同?当我们这样想时，我们会更平静："让我表达自己。没错，我也许会受伤害，如果他们不喜欢我，我会伤心，没问题，我承受得住，我很坚强 我可以接受。"**当我们表达自己，而不是时刻想着表现自己，想象一下我们的生活会变得多轻松。**如果，当我们在教室时，我们感受到这种存在感，越来越多地。。。重申一次，不是完全地，因为这有违人的天性，**但我们可以越来越多地单纯地存在，感激我们的存在，作为一个整体存在。**)
2. The paradox of self-esteem(自尊悖论)
**The paradox of self-esteem of how some people get so much accolade and yet their self-esteem decreases or how some people have high self-esteem or hostile versus others that are generous and benevolent:** Kernis who back in 1995 came up with the concept of **self-esteem stability**, **And he said what actually can predict whether a person will be hostile or generous whether their self-esteem over time will be high or whether it will lower over time is not a self-esteem but rather is the stability of their self-esteem. Same level of self-esteem, People with unstable self-esteem were more likely to be hostile, People with more stable self-esteem were more likely to be generous and benevolent.** resolving a lot of the contradictions misunderstanding in the literature. When I saw this, I had a eureka personal eureka experience And I said "This is it! He's onto something." And what I did in my master's thesis back in 2000 was created a questionnaire, **a very simple questionnaire that measured dependent versus independent self-esteem**, And I measured students mostly Harvard students - I did also cross sectional in Singapore I was spending a lot of time there at the time - similar results Asia and here at least in Singapore and in United States And what **I found was that dependent self-esteem was associated with instability independent self-esteem was associated with stability.** In other words, I came up with one measure that instead measuring ten times whether that kind of self-esteem would lead to hostility anxiety, versus calmness or generosity, I used just one measure And that's what I found **very high correlation between dependent self-esteem and self-esteem instability, positive correlation, and a positive correlation between independent self-esteem and self-esteem stability.**
 (**自尊悖论：也就是说，有些人得到很多赞扬，但他们的自尊下降了；而那些有很高自尊的人，有些有敌对情绪，但有些却对别人宽厚仁慈？** Kernis 他在1995年提出**自尊稳定性**这个概念，他说，**真正能够预测一个人究竟是敌对还是宽厚，他们的自尊会随着时间增高还是降低的，不是自尊本身，而是自尊的稳定性。自尊不稳定的人，更可能充满敌对情绪，而自尊更稳定的人，更可能宽厚仁慈。**这就解释了自尊理论的很多矛盾和误解。当我看到这个理论时，我顿悟了，亲身体验到的一次顿悟，我说："就是它了，他找到答案了。"我在2000年写我的硕士论文时，我设计了一个问卷，一个很简单的问卷，**测量依赖型自尊和独立型自尊的对比。**我测评学生，大部分是哈佛学生，我还在新加坡做了代表性抽样调查，我那时经常在新加坡，得出同样的结果。亚洲和美国的一样，至少新加坡和美国的一样，我发现，**依赖型自尊与不稳定性有关，而独立型自尊与稳定性有关。**换言之，我只测量了一次，而不是十次，到底这种自尊会导致敌对情绪、焦虑，还是平静或宽厚，我只用了一个测量数据。我发现，**依赖性自尊与自尊不稳定性高度相关，两者成正比。** **而独立型自尊和自尊稳定性也成正比。**
 )
3. FLOW(心流)
**Those who had high independent self-esteem were most likely to experience flow on athletic field which is where her research was - Harvard athletics. also connected to higher levels of happiness.** Then my dissertation was trying to pin down these exact characteristics that were problematic in self-esteem literature. Remember, high self-esteem means narcissism. How do you differentiate? Well, what I found in the dissertation was that **narcissism is connected actually to high dependent self-esteem, There was no correlation between independent self-esteem and narcissism.** When it comes to generosity, this was probably the most surprising result of the study, **people with independent self-esteem were actually more generous and benevolent, both in terms of self report and in terms of their actual behavior toward other people - a strong sense of self.** Remember, love your neighbor as you love yourself, Do not do unto others which you would not have done to yourself. And** when you have a high standard for the self, there is a high standard for the other, And that usually happens automatically. because we mirror our behavior toward the "I".**(**独立型自尊与心流的关系：那些有高度独立型自尊的人，最有可能体验到心流。**因为这就是她的研究对象――哈佛运动员。**高度独立自尊的人也有更高的幸福感。**我的论文是想准确地找出**自尊理论存在的问题。**我说过，**高度自尊意味着自恋。**怎么区分这两者?我在论文里发现，**自恋其实是与高度依赖型自尊有关，而自恋与独立型自尊没有什么关系。**至于宽厚，这也许是研究中最令人意外的结果，**有独立型自尊的人，其实更宽厚仁兹。不仅自我评价如此，对他人的行为也是如此。** 非常强烈的自我感，我说过，像爱自己一样爱你的邻居，己所不欲，勿施于人。**当你对自我有一个高标准时，对他人也会有一个高标准，通常这是无意识地发生的，因为我们怎么对待他人就会怎么对待自己。** )

4. Remember self-perception theory, **If you want to improve in one area in our lives, the best thing to do is to behave as we would,** if i want high self-esteem, i need to behae like a person with high self-essteem behaves. Why? because **self-esteem is simply an attitude, It's the attitude i have toward the self, It's the i evaluating the me, and to enhance that attitude,** i need to engage -or the most effective way, not the only way, but the most effective way is **to engage in behavior of a person with high self-esteem.** which is why it's so important to have rols models, and i'm saying that in plural, it's important to have role models, (回忆一下自我觉知理论：**如果你想在某个生活领域得到改善，最好的方法就是让自己的行为变得像改善了一样。**如果我想要高度自尊，我的行为就要像一个有高度自尊的人。为什么？因为**自尊是一种态度，是我对自我的态度，是我对自己的评价。**要提高这种态度，我就要。。。或者说最有效的办法，不是唯一的办法，**最有效的办法，就是表现出一个有高度自尊的人的行为，**所以榜样的作用很重要，我说的榜样不止一个，有榜样很重要。)

5. **"Your true potential lies way down in the depths of your soul...in the pit of your stomach past your knowledge, beyond your nervousness and buried under your fears and anxieties As hidden as it may be, it is still there, I know it's there because I've felt it before, and I know it's there in others too, because I've seen others perform miracles, There is a faint glow of unparalleled potential in all of us and when we find it ― it shine."**(**"你真正的潜力埋藏在你的灵魂深处，在你腹部最底处，在你的知识和紧张触及不到的地方，埋藏在你的恐惧和焦虑之下，虽然它隐藏起来了，但它还在那里，我知道，因为我以前感受过它的存在，我知道别人也有，因为我见过别人做过奇迹一般的事，我们体内都有一股无可匹敌的潜力，散发着微弱的光芒，当我们找到它时，它就会发出万丈光芒。"**)
