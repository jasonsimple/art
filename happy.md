# Lesson one: what is positive Psychology ？
1. the notion of embracing stillness.
	* replay might constitute a general mechanism of learning and memory, both learning,understanding, as well as memory, retention.
	* when we reflect, when we replay the material,we are much likely to retain, to remember what we have just been through.
2. three psychologies:
	* behaviorism（行为主义，tipical: B.F.Skinner,John B.Watson,Edward Thorndik）
	* psychoanalysis(精神分析学,tipical: sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, Alfred Adler)
	* humanistic psychology(人本主义心理学)
	
	**behaviorism**
	behaviorism looks at the human entity as basically a collection of behaviors as a box, like a billiard ball knocked around by reinforcements, by punishment, by reward
	(行为主义认为人是一个行为集合,就像一只被击打而四处滚动的台球,被惩罚、被奖励所驱动)
	**psychoanalysis**
	The psychoanalysis is about basically understanding mostly through the subconscious：that's how you understand, that's how you improve the quality of life,
	(精神分析学主要通过潜意识分析，决定如何改善生活)
	**humanistic psychology**
	humanistic psychology said that we are much more than a billiard ball being knocked around. we have spirit, we have a soul, we have cognitions and thoughts that matter.It's not just behavior that is important for understanding as well as improving life。
	(人本主义心理学认为我们不只是被击打的台球，我们有精神、有灵魂，我们有重要的认知与思想，不能只靠行为观察改变人生，人本主义缺乏学术严谨性，但引入了很多精彩的理念，比如对幸福感的研究，乐观主义，善良，道德，美德，爱，两性关系，巅峰体验，自我实现，移情等。)
	
3. information and transformation
	It's not merely about information, It's also about transformation.
	(如何解读信息比关注信息更重要)
	
	Happiness is much more contingent on our state of mind than our status or the state of our bank account.(取决于...的)
	
	covering less, uncovering more.
	
	the metaphor of the class:It's about chipping away the excess stone.It's about getting rid of limitations, of barriers, whether it's the fear of failure, something that we didn't have as kids. it's about chipping away perfectionism that is debilitating and often hurts us. It's about chipping away our ability for success, because maybe we are afraid of success,maybe we feel guilty about some of the things that we have in our life, and that in turn limit us.
	(本课程的精髓：凿去多余的石头，摆脱限制、障碍,害怕失败等，凿除削弱甚至伤害我们的完美主义,凿去成功的能力，因为可能我们会害怕成功，可能我们对过往的一些事情赶到羞耻，而那些会反过来限制我们)
	
4. soul grows more by subtraction than by addition, by get rid of these limitations.
	(为学日益，为道日损)

5. Common sense is not that common, and this especially applies to application.

6. Information is not enough.
	What is wrong is not the great discoverries of science――information is always better than ifnorance(无知), no matter what information or what ignorance. What is wrong is the belief behind the information, the belief that information will change the world. It won't.
	(错不在科学的重大发现：信息总比无知强，不管是什么信息还是哪里无知，错在于信息背后的信念：认为信息会改变世界的信念，但实际上它不会)

7. Questions make difference:The most common source of mistakes in management decisions is the emphasis on finding the right answer rather than the right question.
(问题缔造现实：当做决定时，经常的错误是想找出正确的答案，而不是问正确的问题)

8. the sense of confidence.

9. Note that it is not about helping ourselves and others become happy, it is about becoming happier. happiness is not a binary either-or、zero-one, happiness resides on a continum.
（不是变快乐，而是变的更快乐，快乐从来不是非此即彼）
# Lesson Two: Wy we need positive psychology ？
1. resilience:A class of phenomena characterized by patterns of positive adaptation in the context of significant adversity or risk.
	(心理弹性：一种现象，特征是积极适应的模式，即使是面对非常不利或危险的环境)
	
2. Ordinary characteristics, extraordinary results:
	* Optimism
	* Faith and a sense of meaning
	* Prosocial behavior(利他主义)
	* Focusing on strengths
	* Set goals
	* A role model
	* Social support

3. It is important to appreciate what is good.

4. Questions very often create reality.
	(问题缔造现实：我们所问的问题通常决定了我们追求的东西，所走的路，所过的生活。无论从个人方面，从人际关系方面，抑或从组织方面来说亦是如此。)
	
5.Foucus:From focusing on deficiencies to focusing on strengths.
让人仅能看到自己专注的事物，所以若我们只集中于自身的缺点、弱点，就算初衷再好，那么亦只能看到自己的不足，仿佛体内所蕴含优点与美德并不存在(就像忽视巴士上的小孩children on the bus)。
	
6. We see what we look for and we miss much of what we are not looking for even though it is there... Our experience of the world is heavily influenced by where we place our attention。
	（我们看见我们所盼望的，因此我们亦错过了许多我们没有期盼之物――尽管她们亦在那里…… 我们在这世界的体验，被我们的关注点(所在的位置)深深地影响）

7. I will take action and action will increase our level of confidence, and then more hope and optimism is a result.
# Lesson Three:IS happiness a random phonomano ?
1. from a passive victim to an active agent.(从消极的受害者变成积极的作用者，yes,it's difficult, it's tough, it's unfair, However, it's your responsibility.)

2. Happiness does not spontaneously rise when we take unhappiness away.(幸福不会因为驱除了忧愁而自动增长。)

3. 

# Lesson Four: A positive environment can change people
1. Study the best and applying it to the rest of us.(研究最好的，然后普及到普通大众上)

2. We underestimate our capacity to effect change because we underestimate the growth of an exponential function.（我们低估了我们可以产生改变的能力，因为我们低估了指数增长的速度）

3. Beyond the extremes, additions or subtractions to our external circumstances make very little difference.this is good news and bad news. the bad news is it seems like whatever we do, it doesn't matter, so why am i working hard in order to get that BCG job? why did i work so hard in order to get into this place? and the answer is that yes it won't make a differencce to our wellbeing, but it also doesn't mean that we cannoot increase our level of wellbeing. (除去极端情况，增加或减少的外部环境产生的区别很小,well，这既是好消息，也是坏消息。坏消息是：看起来不论我们怎么做，都无关紧要，那我为什么还要努力争取好工作，为什么还要拼命入读斯坦福？答案是：是的，它不会改变我们的幸福水平，但并不意味着我们不能提升自己的幸福水平)

4. The problem is not lower these high expectations, that doesn't matter, the problem is right versus wrong expectations, not lowe high expectations that won't make a difference to our levels of wellbeing, what will make a difference to our levels of wellbeing is if we have right vs wrong expectations. It is wrong expectation to expect that getting into a certain palce, getting a raise , finding our dream partner, is responsible for our happiness. but that in end of of itself will not make us happier, the right expectation is to believe in change from within. so these things will not make us happy. in fact, our readiness and potential to experience happiness is mostly depended on our state of mind, not on our status, or the states of our bank account. it is about changing our perception -- state of mind. it's about changing our interpretation of the world, of what's happening to us, of our achievements, of our failures, it's about what we choose to perceive, what we choose to focus on, it's about transformation, as opposed to the external information or the external success.(问题不在于是否降低那些高的期望，这一点都不重要,问题在于正确和错误的期望，而不是低的和高的期望，低的或高的期望不会影响我们的幸福水平，能影响幸福水平的是我们的期望是正确的还是错误的。错误的期望认为进入某个公司，获得升职，找到理想伴侣等，就能让自己更快乐，这本身不会让我们更快乐，那是错误的期望，正确的期望是相信内在的改变，这些事情不会使我们更快乐。实际上，我们准备和体验幸福的可能性主要由我们的心境决定，而不是我们的地位或是银行账户状况。我们要改变我们的认知、心境，要改变我们对设计的诠释，以及我们的遭遇、成就、失败，重要的是我们选择领悟什么，精力集中的焦点是什么，重要的是转变，而不是外部信息或外部成功)
5. Human nature is immutable(constrained), we have inclinations, we have certain instincts that are there and have been formed either God-given or evolutionary-given for millions of years that have been formed. they are mot going to change any time soon, not in our life time. It's fixed, we are stuck with them through good and ill. and all we can do after we accept this nature is to first understand it through research, and then after we understand it, make the best use of it. (人的本性是不变的，我们有欲望，有生而有之的本能，或上天赐予或经几百万年的进化中形成,它们不会轻易的改变，至少在我们有生之年不会，它是固有的，不论好坏，我们都要接受它们，在接受这个本性后，我们唯一能做的是通过研究首先来理解它，然后好好利用它)（Tal 观点）

6. How can i channel my nature ?(如何引导本性)
	* the permission to be human.(准许为人)
		*- The last thing in the world that i want you to think is that i experience a constant high or that you will experience a constant high.（谁都不能一直保持快乐，快乐、悲伤、焦虑...是作为正常人都要经历）
		*- When we suppress a natural phenomenon, that phenomenon only strengthens.(当我们压抑一种自然现象时，那种现象只会加强)
		*- Rejecting our nature leads to suboptimal performance, emotionally as well as in terms of external performance.(拒绝本性导致次优表现,不论在情绪上还是外在表现)

		
		
Lesson 5：
1. Happiness is the meaning and purpose of life, the whole aim and end of human existence.(快乐是生活的意义和目的，是人类存在的最终目标--亚里士多德)
2. Positive emotions help us overcome negative emotions. (积极的情绪有助于我们克服消极的情绪)
	* what happens when we experience negative emotions is that our consciousness, our thinking narrows and constricts, we focus just on one thing, if my consciousness continues to narrow and constrict beyond the threat, or beyond the hardship, and what we know is that very often we enter a downward spiral(I meet a sad thing, and i narrow and constrict in terms of my thinking--all i am thinking about is just that, ant then what will happen is as a result, i experience sadness, because that is what i am thinking about, and sadness-- a painful emotion, not a positive emotion--leads to further narrow and constrict, and that can potentially, not always, but potentially can go on and on and on,and that's when it can become depression, That's when i have difficulty getting out of this downward, vicious cycle. )(当我们处于消极情绪时，我们的意识和思考都变得狭窄、收紧，我们的目光只集中在一件事上，如果我的意识继续狭窄、收紧以致超出威胁，超出困难，我们将经常会进入下行螺旋)
	* Positive emotions do the opposite, they broaden and build. broaden and build leads to positive emotions, and posiive emotions further broaden and build. so that's a virtuous cycle. and i look broad, i look to other people, i look to other things:So what can i do now？ where can i go? where can i spend my time? and very often what that does--a positive emotion can take us out of this downward spiral, and create an upward spiral.（积极情绪正好相反，它们扩展建立，扩展和建立导致积极情绪，积极情绪再进一步扩展，这是一个良性循环，我眼界宽了，我关注其他人，我关注其他事，思考现在我能做什么，我能去哪里，我把时间用在哪里，很经常的是，积极情绪把我们带出下行螺旋，形成上行螺旋）

3. "No pain no gain" is wrong.

4. People mostly do what you do, rather than what you say.(多数人都是照你做的做而不是照你说的做)

5. 传播快乐的最佳方法是努力争取自己的快乐，因为那时你就成为了榜样，这也适用于领导。
6. Be the change you want to see in the world by example.(成为你想在世界上见到的改变)

7. Beliefs are self-fulling propnecies.(信念即自我实现语言)(例子：四分钟跑完一公里)



# Lesson 6: 
	Can we also create a powerful, positve situation to bring out the best in people?
	Whether you think you can or can't, you are right.
	
# Lesson 6: optimism
1. based on the power of the mind. 因为精神的力量
2. Beliefs very often become self-fulfilling prophecies.(信念常常会成为自我实现的预言)：
- motivation:(动力)
- the motion of consisitency or congruence：The mind does not like when there is a discrepancy between what is inside and what is outside, the mind like when there is consistency, and if there is no congruence, then we experience a sense of dissidence, then we experience disease, Doesn't feel good, doesn't fell right and we do, very often, everything that we can to get the two on par again, Either by changing the external reality or by changing our mind to match the external reality , we don't like when there is inconsistency.(一致性或相合性:我们的精神不喜欢内部与外部存在差异，我们的精神喜欢两者一致相合，如果不相合，如果不一致，我们就会产生异议感，觉得不适，感觉不舒服，不对劲，所以我们常常不惜一切让两者统一,要么改变外部现实，要么改变自我思维以符合外部现实)
4. Ways to create this consistency again:(重新创造新的一致性或相合性的方法)
- update schema.(更新图式)
- ignore or discard external information that doesn't match our schema.(忽视或抛弃不符合图式的外部信息)
- activately seek confirmation.(我们主动寻求验证：我们会主动寻求信息，以支持我们的图式。)
- create a new reality.(创造一个新现实)

5. ways to interpret our performance:(解读自己表现的方法)
- object interpretation(客观解读)
- subjective interpretation based on my beliefs:(由信仰决定的主观解读：爱迪生灯泡实验，客观事实是失败了5000多次，主观解读是我成功了5000多次，证明了那些方法不可行)
3. 《适应力》：两周训练教孩子们更加乐观
4. specify unrealistic belief：(辨别不现实的信念)
- the Stockdale paradox：you must never confuse faith that you would prevail in the end which you can never afford to lose with the discipline to confront the most brutal facts of your current reality whatever they might be.(斯托克代尔悖论：你不能把坚信自己最终会在输不起的情形下取得胜利的信念同直面现有残酷现实的行为相混淆，无论是何种残酷现实)
5. the graceful integration between high level of beliefs and connection to reality.(高水平信念和现实联系间的完美整合，maslow)：
Even if we don't success we just bounce back up, the key thought is as much as possible to attain this balance.(即使没有成功，我们也能很快恢复动力，而关键就是尽可能地保持平衡)
6. optimism, passion and hard work.(成功的必备三要素)
7. why did very often parents and people who care about us lower our expectations?(为什么父母及亲人常常要降低我们的期望呢？)
因为他们关心我们的快乐水平，他们关心我们的自尊，you see, there is a lot of belief...people believe that high expectations naturally lead to disappointment.因为有很多....人们相信，高期望自然地导致失望。

8. When we fail after coping we realize that the actual pain that comes with failure is far less than the pain we imagine and that we associate with failure. I just got over it. Okay, so i didn't do well in here, but i got over it, whereas i imagine it in my mind i think it'll last forever.(我们在面对失败后会意识到，真正来自于失败的痛苦远小于我们想象的，我们认为与失败有关的痛苦，是的我在这件事上我没做好，但我克服了，但我一直在想的话，我就会认为它将一直持续。所以当我意识到实际上的痛苦比和失败有关的痛苦远远要小时，我变得更自信了，我能应付了，我实际上比自己想象中要更有适应力，我的自尊水平上升了，我的快乐水平上升了，也有更多的成功了。)

#Lesson 7:Prosperity or adversity?
顺境还是逆境？
1. Positive is an interpretation style, not as a pollyannaish feel-good kind of approach.(乐观是指诠释的方式，而不是盲目地自我感觉良好的方式.)
2. How do we become more of an optimism?
-  take action, to just do it, to put ourselves on the line.(采取行动，把自己置于风险之中)
- the power of imagination, image sucess(想象的力量：我们的大脑无法区分想象和现实，同时，我们的大脑不喜欢不一致，因此我们常常会创造现实，将想象现实化，思想是个模拟器，想象不能只关注结果，应该包含过程和结果。).
- cognitive therapy.(认知疗法，目前最有效的干预手段：要唤起情绪，要对自己正在做的赶到非常兴奋，)
##3. 认知疗法：
### some experiment:
* Five-year Cambridge somerville study that failed.(失败的五年剑桥-萨默维尔研究)
* karen Reivich teaches these cognitive skills in two program(karen Reivich两周认知疗法训练)
* 
- 认识轴：Event→Evaluation(Thought)→Emotion
- 
###3Ms:the 3 traps of irrational thoughts.(非理性想法的三个陷阱)
- the first one is magnifying《 it's exaggerating something that happens.(夸大发生的事情，例如：归纳是人类的本能，但有时我们又做的过头，归纳过度了，例如我期中考试成绩很差，归纳为我不聪明，我不能成功，他的归纳就过度了， Evaluation过度了。)
- minimizing: the first idea of minimizing is what Karen Reivich calls tunnel vision (极小化，Karen Reivich 称之为“隧道视野”，这是我仍要警惕的陷阱:经常关注大部分中的极小部分，并以此评价整体，例如大部分学生都在认真听课，只有一个学生在睡觉，然而我的注意力全在这个学生身上，并以此评价我的课程枯燥，又或者是完美主义中特别关注极小的不完美。)
- Making up or fabricating.(虚构、或称捏造不成立的理由，不要过度个人化，或过度责备)
- emotional reasoning, the key is to get real.(情感推理：情感只是情感，不要把他与个人的现实联系起来,情感的关键是真实化（你嫉妒，并不证明你是个坏人，你害怕失败，并不证明失败是很危险的）)

how do we get real through the questions that we ask ?(如何通过我们的提问变真实？)
- my conclusion tied to reality?(我的结论和现实相关吗？)
- Is that rational? (那合理吗？)
- Am I ignoring something important?(我忽略了什么重要的事吗？)
- what important evidences do i still need to take into consideration?(有什么重要的迹象是我需要考虑的？)
- what am i magnifying? what am i minimizing?(我在夸大什么？我又在贬低什么？)

##4. Focus(聚焦点)
1. Ed Diener: It appears that the way people perceive the world is much more important to happiness than objective circumstances.It's much more dependent on our state of mind, on what we choose to focus on.(Ed Diener的研究发现，对幸福而言，人们感知世界的方式，比客观环境更重要,它更依赖于我们的思想状态，依赖于我们选择什么)
2. we create reality.(现实由我们创造。)
3. this class is not advocating focusing only on the positive, its focus is advocating reality.(本课程不是提倡只专注积极面，它专注于提倡现实)
4. just remember, much of what we experience, we co-create.(只要记住，我们经历的大部分事情，我们参与创造)

# Lesson 8: appreciate(感激)
1. 修女实验：乐观的人更长寿.
2. appreciate:a. 感激；b. 升值因为它能帮我们逃离险境，
3. appreciate has to be genuine. (感激一定要真诚.)
4. What you focus on expands, and when you focus on the goodness in your life, you create more of it. opportunities, relationships, even money flowed my way when i learned to be grateful, no matter what happened in my life. Because what we focus on appreciates.(你专注的东西会变大，当你专注于生活中的好事上，你就能创造出更多好事，机会、恋情、甚至钱都会向你滚来，当我学会感激，不管我生活中发生了什么事，因为我们专注的东西会升值。)
5. Two questions:
6. since positive people live longer, then why people don't be happy?
- the answer is the media appears to broadcast unhappy things, the media does focus to  the great extent on the negative. the media doesn't just report reality as it is, it highlights certain aspects of reality, and there is a media bias involved, a bias toward the negative. the media focuses, highlights the negative, it acts as a magnifying glass rather than as a looking glass. we need to keep that in mind, and to correct for that(既然乐观的人更长寿，那么人们为什么不变的更乐观？――答案是：媒体是罪魁祸首，媒体把大量关注点放在负面新闻上，媒体报道时并不是就事论事，而是单独强调事件中的某几个方面，这就是所谓的媒体偏见，一种倾向于负面的偏见, 媒体关注、突出的是负面，它就像一面放大镜，而不是眼睛，我们需要记住这点，并对此加以修正)
- Another reason in addition to media why we tend to ignore the good and focus mostly on the bad is that we adapt to what is common and what drives us, what's interesting to us is the uncommon, the exception rather than the rule. and because there is so much more good in the world, it's so much more common, we adapt to it. we stop seeing it after a while, whereas the bad, the exception always captures our attention。Why? because nature create us such that we are changed detecters, (and whenever there is a change, our mind immediately goes to that change. It's a good thing that nature creates us that way, because it helps us in case of danger. Now it's actually a good thing that we adapt on a few levels, First of all, if we didn't adapt, we will hearing all the noises, we will quite literally go nuts, so it's good thing that we can adapt,除了媒体总是报道负面新闻以外，另一个原因是我们倾向于忽视了好事，专注于坏事上我们会适应于习以为常的事，驱使我们，吸引我们的是不平常的事，是反常，而不是常态，因为世界上有很多好事，好事太多了，我们就习惯了，我们就再也看不到好事，而坏事是一种反常，总能吸引到我们的注意力.为什么会这样？因为大自然把我们改造成变化探测器，当有变化发生时，我们的头脑就马上专注于变化上，大自然把我们改造成这样是好事，某种程度上来说，适应性是好事，首先，如果我们不适应，我们就会听到各种各样的吵声，我们会变疯的，所以适应性是好事，在困境中也一样。)
7.adaptation(适应)
Tal, what i am going to tell you now is not going to make sense, but it's true, you are going to get over this, I know you are, we get over losses, It's difficult, It's painful, so cry, give the emotions their spaces, but you are going to get over it, we get over painful emotions, we all do, because if we hadn't, then God help us all.(Tal, 我现在跟你说的话可能没意义，但是我说的是真的，你会撑过去的，我知道你会的，我们会撑过丧亲之痛，虽然很难，很痛苦，所以哭吧，把情绪释放出来，但你会撑过去的，我们都能克服痛苦的情绪，我们都能，因为如果我们不能，那只有主能救我们)
8. we adapt and that's a good thing, That's an important thing. but there is another side though to that equation, when we adapt, we also take things for granted, and that's not a good thing. and that's not a good thing, because we take for granted our family that we care about so much, we take for granted our friends...., It's not a good thing. and the question we need to ask is : Is it possible to have it all? Is it possible to adapt to the negatives, but at the same time, not to adapt as much to the positive？ yes ,It's posssible, and the answer is "adapt the negative, and appreciate the positive."(适应性是一种好事，是一种很重要的能力.但是，适应性也有坏的一方面，当我们适应了，我们就会习以为常，我们对家庭习以为常，我们对友情习以为常，这不是件好事。那么问题来了，是否有可能我们适应消极面，但同时，适应积极面. 是的，有可能，而秘诀就是：适应消极面，感激积极面。)
9. if we don't appreciate the good as well, the good depreciates.(如果我们不感激好事，好事就会贬值)
10. The parasympathetic system increases when we are grateful, and that induces calm. and that strengthens our immune system.gratefulness is not just a state of being. it's also about the trait.(当我们感激时，副交感神经系统功能增强，使我们变平静，从而加强免疫系统。感激不只是一种心情状态，它也是一种性格。)

11. how do we cultivate grateful?(如何培养感激？)
- by doing it over and over again.the key when we do this is to maintain freshness.(一遍又一遍的重复做，关键是要保持新鲜感)
12. how to maintain freshness?
- One of the exercise above is that it very often becomes a habit and we lose it, we lose the freshness of it, we lose the mindfulness of it.
- variety really is the spice of life.so do it change (变化是生活的调味剂，所以变着法做，善于发现新的闪光点)
13. The key of appreciate is not just a thank you note, or a thank you phone call, It's sitting down and thinking, what can i be grateful for (my mom)? what has she done to me? what has she given me throughout these years? and really thinking about it, or really thinking a thing. Don't take it for granted. Express it.(感激的关键不是一张感谢信，或者一通感谢电话，它需要坐下来思考，我能感激(妈妈)什么？她都为我做了什么？这些年来，她都给予了我哪些？认真地去思考，认真思考. 不要视之为理所当然，表达出来！！！)
14. One of the most effective interventions out there today is expressing gratitude to others especially this one:Writting a letter of gratitude and then visiting the person to whom you are writting and reading them the letter. Cheesy? I agree. A little bit embarrassing? sometimes. You cannot imagine the kind of result that people get when doing just this gratitude visit.the largest peak, boost, spike in wellbeing when we are expressing gratitude to others, Quite remarkable if you think about it. And if you think about it further, it's a win-win. The downside of this intervention is while it leads to a spike in well-being, the spike usually goes away after about a month, It varies: it can go away after a week or after three months. But the average it goes away after about a month, the spike to well-being, so the key you want to maintain the spike is to do it regularly.Either once a week. once two weeks. once a month. Do it. make it ritual.Again, Variety, variety really helps here. But do it regularly as ritual.(当今最有效的一种干预形式是向他人表达感激之情，尤其是这种方法：写一封表达感激的信然后去拜访收信人，再把信读给他们听。俗气？我同意，难为情？有时是的，你无法想象，人们做感激拜访时获得的结果，(但即使你不去拜访，你觉得害羞，那就把信寄出去再打电话，致电前思考几分钟，“我要说些什么？我到底要感激什么？”)，表达感激时，是最让我们感到幸福的时候。想想吧，相当不可思议。进一步思考会发现它是双赢的。这种干预的不利之处是，虽然它能让幸福感达到峰值，但一个月后，幸福感会消退，时间不同，可能是一周或者三个月后，但平均来说一个月后幸福感的峰值会消退，所以保持这个峰值的关键就是经常去做。每周做一次，每两周做一次或者每月做一次，just do it.把它变成仪式，但还是要有变化，形式的变化很有帮助，但把它作为一种仪式经常去做。)
15. Here's one of the surprising findings that sonja Lyubomirsky found. What she found is that if we write that letter, we get the spike in wellbeing even if we don't send it, Obviously if we send it and we get feedback, the spike is even higher. But just the act of writting it, of being grateful, being open, that in and of itself contributes to wellbeing.(这里有项惊人的发现，是Sonja Lyubomirsky的发现，他发现如果我们写了那封信，就算不寄出去，幸福感也能达到峰值，寄出去当然会得到回应，峰值会更高，但仅仅是书写，感受感激之情，，敞开心扉，这样做的本身也有助于提升幸福感。)
# Lesson 9: posiive emotion.积极情绪
1. They(children) don't take anything for granted. They see life as a miracle. You know, Emerson once said, "If the stars would shine once in a thousand years, we would all look up and praise the glory of this world. But because they shine every day, we take them for granted." For children, that dosen't exist. and part of the reason why it dosen't exist is that because they don't think automatically, conceptually. they think more perceptually, or sensually. and they remain connected to real.and we can do it simply by visualizing.(孩子们不把任何事视为理所当然，他们视为生命的奇迹，艾默生曾经说过，如果星星每千年闪烁一次，我们都会仰视赞美这个世界的美丽，但是因为他们每天都在闪烁，我们就将之视为理所当然。在孩子眼中不存在理所当然，其中一个原因是因为他们不会自动地概念性地思考，他们的思维是感知感性的,他们和现实保持联系。通过在脑海中想象，我们就能做到(William James大楼里的研究成果))
2. The key is to do it, To just do it, there are no short cuts(关键是去做，亲力亲为，没有捷径。)
3. How we deal with painful and positive emotions? Sonja Lyubomirsky的研究
研究：邀请参与者谈论和分享他们生活中最糟糕的经历和最好的经历，她把他们分成四组：
连续3天，每天15分钟。
- 第一组： 写出来，写出三方面，一是影响，也就是情感(emotion)；二是行为(behavior)，即你当时做了什么；三是认知，即你当时的想法。
- 第二组：对着录音机说，讲述最好的经历。
- 第三组：对着录音机说，讲述最糟糕的经历。
- 第四组：只是去想(Just think about it)。
观察他们身体和心理的健康状况，他们的情绪和有多快乐，结果如下：
**写下、录下、想最糟糕的经历**
- 写下最糟糕经历的人事实上感觉更好了，身体上也更健康；
- 对着录音机说的人，在谈论之后感觉更好了；
- 那些沉思的人，不去谈论，不去书写，他们感觉更糟了，一个月后身体状况也更糟；
**写下、录下、想最快乐的经历**
- 写下最快乐经历的人，趋势相反，一个月后，他们的身体和心理都感觉更糟；
- 谈论影响、行为、认知三样的人，一个月后同样感觉更好，但身体状况更差；
- 沉思他们的积极经历的人，一个月后感觉更好更健康。

上述结果很出乎意料，已是他们继续做了第三项研究：
there is a distinction between analyzing and replaying, when we analyze an experience, when we make sense of it, it helps. It actually helps. Painful experiences and negative experiences, which is why therapy helps. and what helps in therapy more than anything is are they empathic, In other words, are they good listeners? so when we feel like we can talk and analyze about painful emotion, we feel batter. we are physically healthier, When we simply sit down and ruminate about painful emotions without making sense of it, we get very often into a downward spiral. we narrow and constrict. we feel more sad. we narrow and constrict even more. and so on and so on, In contrast, we are not sure why, when we analyze a positive experience, really analyze it, try to understand why it happened and so on, It actually dosen't help. we don't understand why. But maybe it's because it takes all the fun spontaneity from the experience. However when we just ruminate about the positive experience, just think about it, then it contributes to our well-being. The gratitude exercise is about replaying the expericence. It's exactly that. In other words, It's thinking about our happiest experiences of the day which leads ultimately to positive outcome. so what is it saying about the permission to be human?  How is it different? Because the permission to be human is also very much related to being happier and healthier in the long term, well here's the difference:with the permission to be human, we give ourselves the permission to experience the emotions, for as long as necessary, and then we ask ourselves:"so what would be the most effective way to act now? ", and one of the most effective way to act would be to share that experience. one of the most effective way to act would be to just write in our journal. Daily active acceptance. Not just ruminating and staying there with this painful emotion. (分析和重现之间是有区别的，当我们分析一次经历时，当我们理清它时，它真的有帮助，痛苦的经历和消极的经历，所以心理治疗才有帮助，心理治疗中最重要的是他们的感同身受，换言之，他们是不是好的聆听者？当我们觉得可以谈论或者分析痛苦情绪时，我们感觉更好，身体更健康，当我们只是坐下来，沉思痛苦的情绪却不去理清它时，我们经常进入下行螺旋，我们收窄压缩，感觉更悲哀，然后进一步收窄压缩，循环往复。相反的，虽然不清楚原因，当我们分析积极的经历时，真正地分析它，尝试理解为什么会发生等等，它确实没有帮助，我们不明白为什么，但也许是因为让我们回忆起经历的快乐之处，但当我们只是沉思积极经历时，只是想也会提升我们的幸福感，感激修习就是重播快乐经历，就是如此，换言之，就是说回想最快乐的日子，能自动导致积极的结果，那么准许为人说的是什么？有什么区别？因为准许为人也是为了实现长期的快乐和健康，区别是这样的：准许为人，我们准许自己感受各种情绪，只要有必要，然后我们自问：“现在最有效的行动是什么？”，最有效的行动之一是去分享那次经历，最有效的行动之一是写日记，接受每天的行为，不要苦苦沉思痛苦的情绪<美国越战老兵受到战争创伤后遗症比二战老兵受到的战争创伤后遗症更大，原因之一就是越战是受反对的战争，越战老兵回到家后闭口不言战争的可怕经历，只有在脑海中反复回忆恐怖的事情，而二战是受支持的，二战老兵回到家会跟别人倾诉战争的可怕事情>)

4. some poetry:
- David Steindl-Rast:"We live in a 'given' world. what brings fulfillment is gracefulness, the simple response of our heart to this given life in all its fullness."(我们生活在一个给予的世界，带来满足的是感激之情，心灵对此给予人生的简单回应就是圆满。)
- Galway Kinnel:“To live and die in gratefulness, if no other virtue.”(感激地活着和死去，若无其他美德)
- Cicero:"Gratitude is not only the greatest of virtues, but the parent of all others."(感激不仅是最大的美德，也是其他美德的发源。)(因为感激，才不会认为理所当然，才不会视而不见)
- Helen Keller:"I wondered how it was possible to walk for an hour through the woods and see nothing of note. I who cannot see find hundreds of things:the delicate symmetry of a leaf, the smooth skin of a silver birch, the rough, shaggy bark of a pine. I who am blind can give one hint to those who see: use your eyes as if tomorrow you will have been stricken blind. Hear the music of voices, the songs of a bird, the mighty strains of an orchestra as if you would be stricken deaf tomorrow. Touch each object as if tomorrow your tactile sense would fail. Smell the perfume of flowers, taste with relish each morsel, as if tomorrow you could never taste or smell again. Make the most of every sense. which the world reveals to you." Take a minute twice a day to focus on what is going on around you, Take a minute when on your way to class to look at the beautiful grass, the beautiful trees, the beautiful snow." Take a minute in the evening to reflect and think about the day you had, and to write down the things for which you are grateful. Today over lunch, just by a little bit slower than you do normally and taste, experience the taste, Because it is a privilege to have the food that we have. It is aprivilege to have the friends that we  have, the family that we have, and we shouldn't take that privilege for granted. Becuase what we don't appreciate unfortunately depreciates.  We don't need to wait for a threat, for a tragedy, for us to appreciate what's all around us and within us.(我奇怪怎么可能在树林里走了一小时后，切什么都没看到，我虽然看不到，切发现许多东西，精美对称的叶子，银色白桦的光滑树皮，松树粗糙的树皮，我一个瞎子也能给看得见的人一个提示，像明天就会瞎掉那样用你们的眼睛，听声音的乐曲、鸟的鸣唱，一个管弦乐队的强劲旋律，仿佛明天你就会突然聋掉，像明天就会失去触觉那样触摸每样东西，闻花朵的香气，品尝每一口的气味，仿佛明天你将永远失去味觉和嗅觉，充分利用每一种感官，感受着世界向你展现的每一面的美好、愉悦和美丽。每天两次花一分钟时间留意周遭的一切，花一分钟的时间在上课的路上看看美丽的草地，青翠的树、美丽的雪，晚上用一分钟去回忆，回想你度过的一天，写下让你心怀感激的事物，今天吃晚餐时，略比平时吃得慢些去品尝，体验品尝的滋味，因为我们所吃得事物是中特权，朋友是我们的特权，家人是我们的特权，我们不应视特权为理所当然。因为我们不知欣赏的就会贬值，我们不需要经历一次威胁，一出悲剧，才去感激周遭和内心感受的一切。)

# Lession 10 change(改变)
1. change is hard. but it can be.(改变是很困难的，但是是可能的。)
2. What does change look like? What happens in our brain when change occurs? (改变是什么样的？改变发生时，我们的大脑有什么变化？)
	Understanding this neuroplasiticity, understanding how we acctually can change can make us more likely to succeed in one of the ways of successed, to actually become happier. your thought pattern follows a certain path, The experience is much likely to gravitate to already established neural pathways and strengthen it further, as opposed to create new neural pathways, which is why if we want to remember somthing, it's very good to make connections to other things, to existing neural pathways, to existing memories, and established neural pathway attracts more action, and it attracts more action and gets thicker. something that's not established, a tiny little stream is more likely to be just wiped away. as it grows more, it's more likely to stay, not just stay, grow even more. It is self-reinforcing. And this is waht habits are, when something is reinforced over and over again, it becomes a habit, .(Carol Dweck's reseach).(理解神经可塑性， 理解我们如何实现改变能让我们更成功，能让我们更加快乐：你的思维模式有特定的路径运作，我们的经历也倾向于流向已建成的神经通道并进一步加固它，而不是生成一条新的神经通道，所以如果我们想记住什么东西，和其他东西产生联系是个很好的方法，和已有的神经通道，已有的记忆产生联系，已建成的神经通道吸引更多活动，从而变得更厚，没有建成的通道，一条小溪更容易消失，当他变得更宽，就更可能保留下来，不仅保留下来而且能继续生长，它是自行巩固的，习惯就是如此，当一种做法被反复巩固，它就变成一种习惯。)(Carol Dweck 的研究，强制伦敦司机记住地图才能有许可证实验)
3. Important thing to keep in mind then is that very often the same trigger causes very different reactions. Again the world is not just the external world. It's also the internal world. Remember to the different mind, as Emerson said, the same world can be a heaven or a hell, Depends on what that experience gravitates toward. Over the years, I've become a much more of a benefit finder through the exerccise, through tinking about it, by writting, keeping a journal, by physically exercising, I become much more of a benefit finder. I have done a lot of work in that. (需要记住的更重要的事是，相同的刺激往往造成不同的反应，再次重申，世界不只是外在世界，还有个内在世界，正如艾默生所说，同样的世界，对不同头脑来说，既可能是天堂也可能是地狱，要看那种经验流向哪里，多年来，我变得更像一个积极者，通过修习、通过沉思、通过书写、写日记、通过锻炼身体，我变成了积极者，为此我付出了很多努力。)
4. One of the great fortunes in my life is that I married a consummate benefit finder, my wife doesn't have to work that hard at it.(我人生最大的财富之一是我娶了一个完美的积极者，我的妻子她不需要后天的努力。)
5. 左侧大脑负责快乐，右侧大脑负责抑郁
6. Maritin Seligman:"The belief that we can rely on shortcuts to gratification and bypass the exercise of personal strengths and virtues is folly. It leads to legions of hunanity who are depressed in the middle of great wealth and starving to death spiritually".(相信有捷径通向满足绕过个人力量和美德的训练是很蠢的，它导致很多人在坐拥巨大财富时感到抑郁，精神饥渴而死。)
7. No five easy steps to happiness.(没有所谓什么“幸福生活五步走”。)
8. Before we go to the change process, there are a few things we need to understand.(在开始改变的行动之前，有些事需要厘清：)
	- a. The first thing to understand is this: Do I really want to change? Do I really want to improve certain things in my personality things that or character, or behavior, things that i don't like. and it's not a trivial question. It's not a rhetorical question, because very often on the conscious level we maybe saying yes, but on the subconscious level something is stopping us. (我真的想要改变吗？我是不是真的想要改善我的个性，或者我不喜欢的性格或行为？这不是一个无关紧要的问题，也不是象征性地问自己一下，因为表面上我们可能会说当然了，但是潜意识里却又东西在阻挠我们，(80年代Langer和Thompson所做实验，虽是负面性格，但从另一方面又是好的性格，比如古板与言行一致联系，冷酷与严肃认真联系，完美主义与动力和雄心抱负联系，担心和焦虑与责任感联系，冷漠无情与罪恶感联系，精简与失去优势联系，寻找过错和现实主义联系，我们把负面品格与证明品格联系起来了)
9. Happiness, One of the most significant barrier to people's happiness is that they associate happiness with stacking off. Because the dominant paradigm, the dominant mantra in our culture today is "No pain, No gain." If I'm happy now, I ignore experiencing pain. It means I'm letting go. It means I'm not gonna be successful. It means I'm gonna lose my edge. It means I'm gonna lose my drive and ambition. So our subconscious prefers to keep us unhappy. so that we don't lose the other things that we value highly, things such as ambition, things such as having an edge, things such as our hard work. (幸福，通往幸福路上最大的障碍，就是人们把幸福和偷懒联系在一起，因为当今文化中最为人所追捧的，所信奉的真理就是“没有付出就没有回报”。如果我现在很快乐，就意味着我不再经历痛苦，就意味着我放弃了，意味着我不会成功，意味着我失去了棱角，意味着我不再有动力和雄心，所以我们在潜意识里选择不快乐，这样的话，我们就不会失去其他珍贵的东西，比如雄心壮志，比如长处优势，比如勤奋刻苦。)
10. ABC理论：
	A: The **affect**, The emotion.(情感、情绪)
	B: The **behavior**, The action.(行为、行动)
	C: The **cognition**, the thought.(认知、思维)
	Two change mode:(两种改变模式)
	1). gradual(渐进式)
	2). acute(突发式)
	Six different approaches to change(六种变化的方式(ABC * mode))
11. Happiness comprises three factors:(快乐由三个因素决定)
	1). The first factor is the genetic set range, we're all born with certain predisposition toward happiness and well-being, Now some people may look at it and say"That's terrible, that we have a genetic set range.", well, my answer to that is" It's not  good, It's not bad, It's like the law of gravity. It's not good, It's not bad, It is. and nature to be commanded must be obeyed, we need to look at our nature, understand it and then make the best of it". About 50 percent of our levels of well-being of the variance in explaining happiness can't be accounted for by genes, The important thing to keep in mind is that we have a lot of control what we do with these genes.(第一个因素是遗传排列，我们与生俱来就有特定的快乐和健康倾向性体质，现在有些人可能会说，我们还有遗传排列，真是太可怕了，对此，我想说，这不是什么好事，也不是坏事，这只是既定事实，就像万有引力，无所谓好坏，想要支配天性，必先服从天性，我们要认识自己的天性，理解，并充分善用这些天性。我们健康中和快乐相关的指数差异，有50%并不是由遗传所决定的。我们应该随时牢记，对于如何运用这些基因，我们是有很多的支配能力的。)
	The second is external circumstances. of course, external circumstances make a lot of difference, whether we're living in a free country versus oppression, That makes a lot of difference, However, in general, external circumstances beyond the extremes, beyond being homeless on the street, make very little difference, in fact, about 10% of the total variance.(第二个因素是外部环境。当然，外部环境很重要，我们生活在一个自由的国度，还是受人压迫，带来的结果是完全不同的，但总的来说，外部环境只要不过于极端，比如无家可归流浪街头，其实影响不大，事实上，在差异方面只有10%的作用。) 
	The third is intentional activities. The rest of the 40% is accounted for by intentional activities. what that means is what we do, how we act, what we think about, how we interpret the world, what we focus on. In essence, what 1504 is about.These intentional activities, our focus, these are essentially our ABCs, this is what real meaningful change comes, And this is where we are gonna focus. (第三个因素是意向活动。剩下的40%是由意向活动决定的，意向活动包括我们的所作所为所想，我们队世界的诠释和我们关注的焦点，简而言之，就是这门课的内容，这些意向活动，我们关注的焦点，其实就是我们的ABC，这也是产生有意义的变化的根源，是我们将要关注的重点。)
12. He says:"Well, soldiers don't cry". and i stopped crying, and i didn't cry for almost 20 years after that. Then i came to Harvard. and i started to study psychology. and studying psychology, i realized one of the things that i wanted to work on, one of the most important things that i wanted to work on was getting in touch with my feminine side, i wanted to be more in touch with of my feminine side, because i knew that it wasn't healthy to repress emotions. i was repressing painful emotions. the exact same thing happens with positive emotions.(他说(Tal's papa):"那好，士兵是不会哭的"。于是我不哭了，之后将近20年，我再也没哭过，之后我上了哈佛大学，我开始学习心理学，我知道自己想要做的，想要做的最重要的事情之一就是找到自己女性化的一面，我想要找到自己女性化的一面是因为我知道压抑情感是不健康的，我压抑痛苦的情绪，同时也压抑积极正面的情绪。)
13. And i tought about something that Churchill said, which was 'find opportunity in difficulty', So i looked for the opportunity. and here it was an opportunity handed to me in a pink shirt to be more in touch with my feminine side. But the key is to attain optimum levels of discomfort, and why? there is no other way to change, Nothing will happen, unless we bring about real actual behavioral change, and when we do that, then the sky is the limit.(然后我就想到了丘吉尔说过的一句话，“在逆境中寻找转机”，于是我一直在寻找转机，现在转机来了，就在这件粉色衬衫上，让我找到自己女性化的一面，关键是要达到最适度的不适感，为什么呢？想要改变，别无他法，什么也不会发生的，除非我们有真正的实质的行为改变，当我们做到这一点的时候，天高任鸟飞。)

#Lesson 12 Write daily(写日记)
1. Jamie Pennebaker's experience:what he did was bringing participants and have them do the following: on 4 consecutive days that they came in, each day, they would spend 15 minutes- that's all, 15 minutes time for writing about the most difficult experiences, now they knew that no one would see it, or if they would see it, it would be without a name- completely confidential. so they were really able to treat it as their own journal. And here was the instructions that theses participants got. "Write continuously about the most upsetting or traumatic experience of your entire life. Don't worry about grammar, spelling , or sentence structure. In your writing, I want you to discuss your deepest thoughts and feelings about the experience. you can write about anything you want. But whatever you choose, It should be something that has affected you very deeply. Ideally, it should be about something you have not talked about with others in detail. It is critical, however, that let yourself go and touch those deepest emotions and thoughts that you have. In other words, write about what happened and how you felt about it, and how you feel about it now. Finally, you can write on different traumas during each session or the same one over the entire study. your choice of trauma for each session is entirely up to you." simple instructions. pretty straight-forward.if you notice, you see the ABCs in it, so it says "write about what happened", which is the behavior essentially. write about your deepest feelings- your affect, your emotions. and write about your thought and analyze it. and the control group just wrote about anything that they wanted to write about.so when he did this study, initially the results came in, one of the first things he looked at was the anxiety level, so when the results came in, disappointment. In fact, thinking of stopping the study, because he found the control group, their Anxiety show no change over time, the intervention group, the experimental group, after 4 days of writing about their most traumatic, most difficult experiences ,They started at the same point, They were randomly divided. and then a rise in their anxiety, after each of the days and during the 4 days, rise in their levels of anxiety.At the highest point, he was thinking terminating the study- very disappointed. Because he got from personal experience that he knew that journaling helps him and knew other people who talk about it, who swear by journaling, But then, once the 4 days are over, during the fifth, especially starting 6th, 7th and on days, this is what starts to happen. their anxiety levels went down. learning that they reach the same level as before, they continue to go down. and the most important thing is that they stabilized below the previous level. They stabilized below the previous levels of anxiety, when he followed these participants over a longer period of time up to a year. 4 times, 15 minutes- that's total of an hour. That's very little. and long lasting results. After writing about their deepest traumas, They became more outgoing, less repressed, less suppressed. Now why is that? We talked about it often that positive emotions and painful emotions flow through the same pipeline, And if we suppress something, if we stop something, which is painful, we are very often indirectly, inadvertently also suppressing the positive emotions, whereas here they open up, quite literally open up and allow these emotions to flow through them, they are essentially opening up a clogged channel, a clogged channel through which emotions, painful as well as positive emotions normally flow, and they experience higher levels of happiness. they are more open, more generous, as we saw also when you do the gratitude exercise. There were gender differences.(德州大学Jamie Pennebaker 的实验：他选了一些参与者，并让他们做以下的事情：连续四天，每天都用15分钟的时间，就15分钟来写下最难忘的经历，他们知道其实没人会看的，或者就算被人看到了，这些日记也是匿名的，绝对保密，所以完全可以看成他们的私人日记，以下就是他们得到的指示：“连续写下你一生中最难过或最痛苦的经历，不必在意语法、拼写或句子结构，在日记中，我希望你能谈谈你对这经历的最深刻的想法和感受，写什么都行，但不管你选什么，都必须是对你有着深刻影响的，最好是一些你从未怎么跟别人讲过的事，其实挺难得，因为敞开了心扉，去触碰那些你内心深处的感情和思想，换句话说，就算写下你的经历和以前的感想，以及现在对它的看法如何，最后， 你可以每次都写不同的痛苦经历，也可以整个研究过程都写同一个经历，每次你可以选择任何想写的痛苦经历。” 很简单的做法，很直接，如果有留心，就知道当中包含了ABC三个要素，它包含了“写出发生的事”，也就是行为，写下你的深刻感受，收到的影响以及你的情感，写下你的想法并分析它。他还有一个对照组，对照组的成员只是写下他们想写的东西。他做了这项研究后，最初结果出来了，他首先看到的是焦虑水平，因此看到结果时，他失望了，事实上，他考虑要不要停止这项研究，因为这就是他的研究所得，随着时间的推移，对照组的焦虑水平没有改变，而干预组，实验组的成员，经过四天，写下他们最痛苦、最难过的经历后--他们的起点一样，当初分组是随机分配的，他们的焦虑水平竟呈现上升趋势，每天这么写，在这四天内，他们的焦虑水平上升了，到了最高点时，他考虑终止研究，因为非常失望，因为他自己觉得写日记对他有帮助，而也有其他说过这一观点，但是四天之后，从第五天开始，尤其是第六天、第七天之后，奇怪的事发生了，他们的焦虑水平降低了，达到了原来的水平，还持续下降，最重要的是，在原来的水平之下保持稳定，在原来的焦虑水平之下保持稳定，他密切留意着这些参加者一段很长的时间，长达一年。四次，15分钟，足足一小时，时间很短，效果是持续的。在他们记下最深刻伤痛后，他们变得更外向，不那么压抑和忧郁了，为什么会这样呢？我们说过积极情感和痛苦情感都来自同一个输送通道，如果我们抑制着某些事情，或停止一些痛苦的事，我们常常会间接地、同时无意中抑制一些积极的情感，只要他们随时敞开心胸，让这些情绪尽情流露，那他们其实是打开了一条闭塞的通道，一条各种情绪，包括痛苦和积极情绪流通的通道，他们也能体验到更高层次的快乐，他们会更阳光，更慷慨，就像我们做感恩练习时所得的结果一样。)
2. which is interesting, Now both sexes benefited from it, However, men benefited more than women, think about it, why do you think that is? It makes sense, if you think about it, because women have, generally speaking again, (women open up more, they speak more with their girl friends. they have closer friends and they talk about issues.  Men still in our culture today are much more close because it's not cool to open up. It's not cool to give yourself the permission to be human, especially when others are listening, so women generally in their lives have more supports  than men, but still, even women who have strong supports systems still benefit from this exercise, which reminds me of another result of a study, I mentioned months ago, the beginning of the course, which said women generally, again these are all averages, but in general, women, or rather men benefit more from marriage than women. for similar reason. Because women already have the supports system in place. Men, very often, for the first time they are with someone, who they feel comfortably enough opening up to. again, both males and females benefit from a long-term relationship, but men generally tend to benefit more than women.(接上段：有趣的是，会有性别差异，男女都从中受益（写日记），但男士比女士受益的更多，试想一下，为什么会这样，仔细想想，其实不无道理，受益的女士，状况大大改善，但男士受益更多，为什么？因为一般来说，女士敞开的更多，他们和女伴谈得更多，他们有密友，并对他们倾诉一切，而在今天的文化中，男士还是比较保守，因为找人倾诉有点没面子，准许自己为人，不是一件很酷的事，尤其是有其他人在旁时，因此，在生活中，女士们比男士们更容易获得支持，但是尽管如此，拥有强大支持的女士，仍能从这项练习中获益，这让我想起另一项研究的结果，我几个月前提到过，在课程开始时，提到一般来说，男人在婚姻中比女人受益更多，类似的原因，因为女士们原来就有支持系统，而男人，通常这是他们第一次遇到一个让他们觉得能安心倾诉的人，同样，尽管男女都在长期的恋爱关系中获益，但还是男士受益比女士多，)
3. Laura King, a student of pennebaker, took the exact opposite approach and said:"Let's study to see what happens when the individuals write about their most intensive positive experience." what she did specifically was taking the instructions from Abraham Maslow's work on peak experience. and here are the instructions: Once again, this was three times, 15 minutes, so 45 minutes total on three consecutive days. Think of the most wonderful experience or experiences in your life, happiest moments, ecstatic moments, moments of rapture, perhaps from being in love, or from listening to music, or suddenly 'being hit', by a book or painting or from some great creative moment. choose one such experience or moment. Try to imagine yourself at that moment, including all the feelings and emotions associated with the experience. Now write about the experience in as much detail as possible, try to include the feelings, thoughts, and emotions that were present at the time. please try your best to re-experience the emotions involved. Essentially the exact opposite of Pennebaker. Results? Identical, Those who wrote about their peak experiences, their best experiences visit doctors less, in other words, it strengthened their physiological immune system, and experienced more happiness. so both psychological and physiological results. " Now when you look at this, some of you may be thinking that "well, what about the Lyubomirsky study? That said when you write about positive emotions. Actually you feel worse. whereas you write about negative emotions, you do feel better as Pennebaker suggested. Here's the difference. The instructions that Laura King gave were mostly about describing and re-experiencing, replaying your experience. It wasn't about analyzing "why did it happen", "how did it ", it was rather how it happen, in other words, replaying it. When the instructions and this is the Lyubomirsky study, were analyze the experience:why it happened, how did you get there and so on and so on. That's why it had the negative consequences over time, but just replaying the experience, just writing about how wonderful it is, re-experiencing emotionally what that was actually let you benefit.( Laura King的实验： Laura King 是 pennebaker 的学生，用相反的方法来做这项研究，她说：“我们来研究一下，看当人们写下最快乐的经历时会有怎么样的结果”，她的做法明确地根据 Abraham Maslow 关于巅峰经验的研究. 以下就是做法，三次，每次15分钟，连续三天，总共45分钟，想出生命中最精彩的经历，或多次美好的经历，快乐，兴奋的时刻，或坠入爱河极度欢喜的时刻，或者听音乐的欢快时刻，或突然发现一本好书或好画或突然灵感乍现，选择其中一个这样的时刻，想象自己正经历着一时刻，沉浸在所有与这一经历相关的感受和情感中，尽量详细地写下这一次经历，尽量写下感受和想法及当时产生的情感，尽量尝试重新经历那些情感。这个做法和Pennebaker 的做法相反，结果呢？完全一样，那些写下他们巅峰经验的人，写下最快乐经历的人，去看医生的次数少了，就是说，这个做法增强了他们的身体免疫系统，让他们体验更多快乐，不论心理还是身体上都得到同样的效果。现在来看，你们有些人可能会想，那Lyubomirsky的研究呢？那项研究表示，当你写下积极情感时，其实你感觉更糟，而写下负面情感，都会如Pennebaker所说，感觉会好些，不同之处在于，Laura King 的做法主要是描述和重新体验，重现你的经历，而不是分析“怎么会发生这种情况”，而是它的发生过程，就是重现，而Lyubomirsky的研究是分析这种经历，为什么会发生，你为什么会遇上之类的，这就是为什么随着时间推移，会产生负面的效果，但至少重现经历，只写下这次经历有多美好，重新体验当时的情感，实际上会让你受益。)
4. 写日记，分析痛苦的经历能让人减轻焦虑感，重现美好的经历能让人更快乐。
5. Why are there such remarkable benefits to journaling?(为什么写日记能产生如此显著的好处？)
Let's understand the process,the mechanism.So there are a few things that are at play here.One of the things for example with positive emotions is that when you are replaying it,you are simply, you are fortifying the neural pathways. You replay,you imagine it again, and you make it more likely to happen again. Just like when you have a river, remember the analogy from two weeks ago,you have a river, and the more water go through it,then the wider it becomes, and then the more water is likely to go into it. That's self-reinforcing nature of change.So the first thing, the first reason why writing especially about painful emotions, but not just painful emotions, the reason why it helps is because of tension. We talked about ironic processing- Daniel Wegner's work from here, when we suppress unnatural phenomenon,it often intensifies. Be it thinking about a pink elephant, or be it suppressing painful emotions. And when we give ourselves the permission to be human, we are much more likely to release it,to let go, which is why therapy helps,which is why sharing with friends, opening up helps,which is why journaling helps. This is the whole idea of suppression or repression. The second thing that Pennebaker talks about is coherence. One of the things that he finds is that the individuals who benefit most,and he analyzes the test, confidentially of course,but he analyzes the test. Individuals who benefit most from the study are once introduced a lot of insight words,or insight phrases, meaning by the third day,they are all writing "now I see that" or "I understand that". or "it just dawned on me that" or "I realize that". Those who have many of these words or phrases in their writings are the ones who benefited the most. In other words, they've created a sense of coherence out of the experience. They make sense out of something perhaps before that was senseless. In other words,they created a story around their experiences. It's no longer dispersed,disjointed,disconnected data. Now it is a coherent whole.It's a story. Now I can deal with it. And if you think about it,what do people mostly remember? People mostly remember stories. Why? Because you remember a story, because it's one unit- it's a whole. The exact same here. We want to feel that our lives have a sense of coherence that we can make sense of them. Pennebaker: "An artifact of our ambiguous and unpredictable world is the anxiety of not attaining completion and not understanding a simple cause-and-effect explanation for traumatic disturbances. Alas,we naturally search for meaning and the completion of events; it gives us a sense of control and predictability over our lives." Again,that's why therapy helps, because we create coherence out of experience. This is why there was far less post-traumatic stress disorder after the Holocaust after there was the Vietnam war. Because after the Holocaust,they spoke about these experiences. They created a story around it,a tragic one, but still there was a sense of coherence,as opposed to Vietnam,where there was just random flashes of experiences without giving themselves permission,or without society, in many ways,giving them the permission to open up and to create a story out of it that they could hand, they could grasp.(我们来理解一下这个过程当中的原理，现在有几件事情在这里起作用，例如你带着积极情感，在回想其中一次经历，你其实是在增强神经通路，你再次重现、想象它，让它像重新发生一样，就像你面前有条河，记得两周前的类推法吗，你面前有条河，流过的水越多，它就变得越宽阔，然后越来越多水流进去，这是变化的本质：自我实现。因此，为什么写下，尤其是痛苦情感，但也不只是痛苦情感，之所以有所帮助是因为紧张感。我们之前讲过Daniel Wegner的"反语处理"，而他谈到，当我们抑制非自然现象时，通常会适得其反，比如想像一头粉红色的大象，或抑制痛苦的情感，当我们准许自己为人，我们都倾向于释放感情、放开心胸，这就是治疗产生作用的原因，就是为什么和朋友分享、与人倾诉以及写日记能有所帮助，这就是抑制或压抑的概念，Pennebaker所说的另一件事是关联性，他发现的其中一件事是，那些受益最大的人，从这项研究受益最多的人，都使用了一些领悟性的词语或词组，也就是说到了第三天他们都开始写到："现在我知道了"或者"我明白了"，"我突然明白了"或"我意识到"，日记里提及到这些词或短语的次数最多的人，就是受益最大的人，换句话说，他们已从这经历中创造出一种关联性，他们从某些事当中得到了启示，这些事情以前也许是毫无意义的，也就是说，他们围绕着他们的经历创造出故事，这经历已不再是零散的、无关的片段，现在已经是一个连贯、完整的故事，现在我可以面对它了。仔细想想，人们通常最记得的是什么?他们最记得的是故事，为什么?你能记住一个故事？是因为它是一个整体，而同样的道理，我们想感受到我们的生命的关联性，让生命变得有意义。Pennebaker说"我们模糊且无可预知的世界的产物之一就是对不能完满成功而产生的焦虑和无法理解对一些造成痛苦困扰的缘由的简单解释。"我们自然地去寻找事件的意义和完满性，它让我们有了对生命的控制以及预知能力，这再次说明了疗法能起作用的原因，因为我们从经验中创造出关联性，这就是大屠杀造成的创伤后遗症远少于越南战争造成的创伤后遗症的原因，因为在大屠杀之后，士兵们说出了这次经历，他们围绕这次经历讲出一个故事，虽然悲惨，但还是会有关联性。和越战的经历不同，对于越战，他们只有一些零散的记忆，并没有准许自己为人，也没有这样的社会环境或其他途径让他们尽情倾诉，来说出一个他们可以应付、可以接受的故事。
6. three components:(Aaron Antonovsky 发现的三要素)
 * sense of comprehensibility―― I understand the world. It make sense to me. I see. I realize. I get it. The world and event, difficulties and hardships, highs and lows make sense to me mostly. （第一，理解能力：我能理解世界，世界对我很重要，我看得到，感觉的到，理解的了，世界、事件、困难、挫折、生活的高低起伏对我来说是宝贵经历。）
 * sense of manageability―― I can deal with it, i can handle it. I have the internal as well as external resources to deal with it. as opposed to being helpless. This is a sense of efficacy, of confidence being able to deal with the hardships that arise. （第二，掌控（管理）能力：我可以处理的了，能承受的了，我能利用各种内部和外部资源处理事情，而不是孤立无援，这是一种能效，一种自信，能够处理突如其来的困难。）
 * sense of meaningfulness―― according to Antonovsky, that makes up the sense of coherence, This was not in vain-this difficulty, This disagreement with my partner was not for nothing, because we understand one another better now. And we are even close, more intimate. This failure was not in vain. I have learned from it, and i have grown from it, This mistake has reason. again, not necessarily happen for the best, but learning how to make the best of what happens.（第三，意义性：如Antonovsky所说，能够产生关联性的，意义性，困难的出现不适毫无意义的，我和伴侣意见不合不适坏事，因为通过这件事，我们更了解了对方，我们会变得更亲密，我们之间的冲突是有意义的，我已经从中学习到东西，并得到成长，这个错误是有原因的，再次强调，这件事的发生不一定是好的，但可以学习如何在事情发生后用最好的方法解决）
 
 7. a sense of coherence is a global orientation that expresses the external, the extent to which one has a pervasive, enduring though dynamic felling of confidence that: (关联感：是一种整体适应性，对生活的感受性和信心主要包含三个方面：(Pennebaker 和 Antonovsky)):
 * the stimuli deriving from one's  and external environments in the course of living are structured, predictable and explicable(comprehensible, in other words);(第一，在生命中个体感受到来自内外部环境的压力，是明确、具体、可预测的（即领悟性）)；
 * the resources are available to one to meet the demands posed by these stimuli(internal resources and external resources(I can deal with it, I can manage);（第二，个体感受到应对内外部环境压力所需资源是充分的，可以利用的（即可控性））
 * these demands are challenges worthy of investment and engagement(it's meaningful).（第三，个体感受到来自内外部环境的压力具有挑战性，值得花时间和精力去应对。）
 
# Lesson 12 Setting goals(设定目标)
1. Abraham Maslow:" Being focused on a task produces organization for efficiency both within the organism and in the environment."(专注于一个任务可以在个体及自然环境中提高组织效率。)
2. Goals contribute to performance and well-being because they strengthen our resilience.(目标对工作表现及幸福感有重大影响，因为目标会让我们更具适应力)
3. Nietzsche once wrote that if we have a what for, every how becomes possible.(尼采曾写道，只要我们有目标，一切皆有可能。)
4. Goals make us more successful, What we are doing with goals with declaring that we believe we are going to get something. because our mind doesn't like when the reason inconsistency between what is inside and what is outside. It wants there to be match. And if i believe in a goal and i declare a goal, the outside is likely to match that. (目标让我们更成功，就跟积极信念发挥作用的原因一样，有目标就代表我们相信我们会得到某样东西。因为我们的思维不喜欢内部和外部不一致，而希望能相一致，如果我相信一个目标，对外宣告这个目标，那外部事物就会趋向于与这个目标相一致。)
5. The power of the word:words create the world. what words do is essentially create an image in our minds, especially when we imagine the goal. It creates an image im our mind and the mind doesn't know the difference between the imaginary and the real and the mind wants consistency-- that is what goals do. They help us create consistency. (言语的力量：言语创造世界，基本上，言语能在我们的脑海中塑造一幅画面，尤其是我们想象目标时，它在我们脑海中创造一幅画面，而我们并没有意识到该想象和现实之间的差距，我们的思维想让两者统一，目标就是这样起作用。它们让我们更容易让两者统一。)
6. W.H.Murray:"Concerning all acts of creation there is one elementary truth, the ignorance of which kills countless ideas and splendid ppans: That the moment one defnitely commits oneself, then providence moves too. All sorts of things occur to help one that would not have otherwise occurred. A whole stream of events issues from the decision, raising in one's favor all manner of unforeseen incidents and meetings and material assistance which no man would have dreamed would come his way, I have learned a deep respect for one of Goethe's couplets: Whatever you can do, or dream you can, begin it！ Boldness has genius, magic, and power in it. Why it works, how it works--we are not really sure, but it works. Just like when you declare you are looking for computer, suddenly you see all these opportunities. the same with commitments. when we commit, things begin to happen. we begin to identify external resources as well as internal resources. Things that we didn't see before. Because my question becomes "How can i succeed?" and then children on the bus, or the time on the clock suddenly become visible to us, and we are able to succeed... much more likely to succeed than before. Words create worlds. (W.H.Murray: 在所有创造的过程中都有一个基本真理，对它的忽视使得无数优秀创意的计划夭折，那就是一个人一旦全身心投入，就会触动冥冥中的天意，很多帮助他实现目标的事，若非这样也不会发生，这样的决定会带来一系列事件，各种意料之外，对他有所帮助的事件，人和事物，这完全是他之前没有想到的，从歌德的诗文中我有深刻体会：无论你能做什么或梦想什么，去做吧，勇敢带来智慧，魔力和力量，它为什么会起作用，如何起作用，我们不确定，反正就是有用，就像是如果你说要买电脑，就会看到很多机会，投入也是同样的道理，我们投入了，很多事就会接踵而来，我们开始发现外部资源，以及内部资源，会发现之前没看到的东西，因为我的问题变成了“我怎样能成功?” 然后车上的孩子，或时钟的时间忽然变得清晰可见，我们有能力成功，比以前更有可能成功――言语创造世界。)
7. Goals properly understood lead to happiness. And i emphasize "properly understood". Why? Because we know that attaining goals, the attainment of goals does not in and itself lead to happiness. yes, getting tenure will lead to a spike of my well being, but very quickly I'll go back to my base level. It will not lead to long lasting happiness. So that's temporary-- we know that attainment of goals does not lead to happiness. what does lead to happiness? **Understanding the proper role of goals. and understanding that it's not the attaining of a goal that leads to happiness, but the having of a goal that leads to happiness**.(被正确理解的目标会让人幸福，这里我强调“被正确理解”，为什么？因为我们知道实现目标，实现目标本身并不会带来幸福，没错，得到职位我会有短暂的幸福，但很快我就会回归基础水平，它不会带来长期的持续的幸福，我们知道那是短暂的快乐，因此我们知道实现目标不会带来幸福，那什么能带来幸福？充分理解目标的正确作用，要明白到，不是实现目标带来幸福，而是拥有目标让人幸福。)
8. Goals properly understood their role is to liberate us to enjoy the present. what does this mean? Let's say you go off on a road trip, and you have no idea where you are going. you don't have a goal. You don't have a destination in mind. you are less likely rather than more likely to enjoy the journey. Because every minute you will look left or right or ahead to see if you are not falling over the stage; whereas if you know where you are going, you have a sense of direction. you are liberated. you are much more likely to enjoy the process, the flower on the side as well. this also explains why so many people when thy retire, become less happy, even though they've been dreaming of being retired for many years, when they actually retire, they become less happy. the ones who are happier when they retire are the ones who actually set goals for themselves, whether it's taking a class, whether it's learning something new, whether it's spending more time with family and friends, but they have a goal, as opposed to "let's just enjoy ourselves. let's just be". we need that goal-- this outcome, this future orentation, so that we can enjoy the present more. the goals liberate us to enjoy the here and now. In other words, if you think about it, the role of goals is actually means,  thy are means toward an end, and the end are the present experiences. (被正确理解的目标的作用是解放我们，让我们享受当下，这意味着什么？例如你去远足，你不知道自己要去哪，你没目标，心中没有方向，你就不大可能享受旅程，因为每分钟你都在左顾右盼，不知道是否错过什么，如果你知道要去哪，你有方向感，你就被解放了，你就更可能享受旅程，才可以欣赏到路边的鲜花。这也能解释为什么很多人退休后，变得不大开心，尽管他们多年来一直期待着退休，到他们真的退休后，就变得闷闷不乐，那些退休后更开心的人，为自己设定了目标，或是上一门课，或是学新知识，或是和亲人朋友相处更久，他们都有一个目标，而不是“让我们享受生活吧，顺其自然”。我们需要目标，结果，未来的导向，那样我们就能更享受此刻，目标让我们得到解放，才能享受当下。换言之，如果你仔细想想，目标是一种手段，他们是达到结果的一种手段，结果就是当下的体验。)
9. **Goals are means toward the present end**, This explains why so many high achievements are unhappy, and turn to drugs and to alcohol, going to rehab centers constantly, coming out and going back, and we ask ourselves"why? how could it be?" Those people who seemingly have it all, Fame, fortune, beauty, Anyone thay want, the life that most people in the world dream about. How come they end up in a rehab center?  How come they are unhappy? Here's the how come: you see, for years, when they climb up the ranks, when they have the dream of becoming a famous person, a person who is admired, revered, a person who can get anything or anyone almost they want, when they dream about it, they may be unhappy. But they say themselves"OK. I'm unhappy now, but i will be happy when i get there". and then they get there, and they realize that there's no "there" there. They think it would make them happy, but it doesn't, and that's when the real problems begin, Because that's when they begin to experience helplessness. That's when they become resigned. That's when they go into-- **on the hamburger model, that's when they go into the learned helpessness, and resignation and the nihilism.** Because everyone has told them that once they make it then they'll be happy, and they told themselves"once i make it then i will be happy." and they are not any happier for it. Yeah, initially when the fame begins, and when they start having things in their way, as they always dream, of course they are happier. But then they go back to their base level. and when they go to their base level, they are suppressed, they are upset, they are disappointed, and more than anything, they are scared. Because what now? Until that point they were sustained by their hope that when they get there, they'll be happy, but they are not happier, and they are scared. and they are lost, and they look for solutions, very often outside of the normal experiences, outside of ordinary life. and where is that? That very often is with drugs and with alcohol, Because that takes us out of our normal day-to-day, ordinary lives. For good and ill. This misunderstanding prevalent and most people live that way. And they think-- and this is why so many people go through mid-life crisis for example, It's not the only reason. But it's one of the reasons. Because there are many people who are pretty accomplished, who have nailed it, and then they say" What now? Is this all the raise to it? " yes, this is all the raise to it. and the challenge is to identify the treasure of happiness that are embedded, that are there in the it and that are there all around us.(**目标是获得结果的手段**，这解释了为什么如此多的成功者不快乐，如此之多侧成功者沉沦于药品及酒精，他们常进心理治疗中心，那样进进出出，我们问“为什么会这样？”表面上看那些人似乎已得到一切，名声、财富、美人，他们想要的任何人，大部分人梦寐以求的生活，为什么他们最后还要进心理治疗中心？为什么会不开心？现在就来说说原因：多年来，他们不断努力向上，他们心怀梦想，希望成为名人，渴望得到别人的尊敬，渴望得到一切想要的东西或人，当他们梦想这些东西的时候，他们可能是不开心，但他们对自己说：“Ok, 我现在是不开心，但我成功后会很开心”，然后他们成功了，他们意识到并没有料想中的开心，他们以为那会让他们开心，但并没有，那时真正的问题才到来，因为到那时他们才开始体会到无助，那时他们就会放弃，**那时他们就会变得――根据Hamburger 的模型，他们会患上习得性无助，自我放弃和怀疑主义**，因为大家都跟他们说，他们实现了这事就会快乐，而他们也对自己说过“一旦实现了这件事，就会快乐。”但他们并不为此而更快乐，一开始，当刚开始有点名气，他们刚开始走上成功之路，他们常常梦想成功，当然就会快乐一点，但之后他们又回到基础水平，当回到基础水平，他们很压抑，很沮丧，很失望，更甚的是，他们很害怕，因为不知道怎么办好，但在那之前，他们以一种希望支撑着，想着成功后，他们会很快乐，但他们并没有更快乐，他们很害怕，很迷茫，他们想寻求解决方法，这样通常就会脱离正常经验，脱离常规生活，那有什么解决方法呢？常常就是样品和酒精，因为那让我们远离枯燥乏味的日常生活，无论是好的或坏的。这种错误的想法非常普遍，大部分人都如此，他们认为――这就是为什么，这么多人会经历中年危机，这不是唯一的原因，却是其中一个原因。因为有很多非常成功的人，他们成功后会说：“那现在这么办？这就是它带来的快乐吗？”是的，它就只能带来这么多快乐，而面临的难题是去找出埋藏起来的幸福宝藏，它就在我们身边。)
10. Tal:Happiness is not about making it to the peak of the mountain, nor is it about climbing aimlessly around the mountain; Happiness is the experience of climbing toward the peak." It's about having a goal, It is about having a destination in mind, and then letting go and enjoying the process. (Tal:幸福并不是登上山峰，也不是在山的四周没有方向的乱爬，幸福是向山峰攀登的过程，它与设定目标有关，与设定一个终点有关，然后就释放自己，享受过程。)
11. Gwendolyn Brooks:"Live not for battles won, Live not for the end of the song, Live for the along."(Gwendolyn Brooks:"不为胜利而活，不为曲终而活，为美好过程而活。")
12. It's such an important component of happiness is spirituality. the dictionary definition of spirituality is one of the definitions is the real sense of significance of something. So if i see something as significant, as important, as meaningful, I am having a spiritual experience engaging in it.(幸福的重要组成部分是精神性，字典对精神性的定义其中一个是：对有重大意义的事情的感知，因此如果我发现一些极具意义，极其重要的东西，意义非凡的，我就对它有种精神性体验。)
13. The thing to keep in mind is that it doesn't matter what i choose, what direction i go in, If i choose something that is self-concordant that is aligned with my personal goals and mission, I will lead a spirtitual life.(要记住，选择什么，往哪个方向走并不重要，如果我选择的东西是自我和谐的，和我个人的目标和使命相符合，我就会过上精神性生活。)
14. Becoming self-concordant is a difficult skill, requiring both accurate self-perceptual abilities, and the ability to resist social pressures that may sometimes push one in inappropriate directions.(实现自我和谐是非常困难的，要求精确的自我知觉能力，还有抵抗社会压力的能力，那种压力有时会把人迫往错误的方向。)
15. **Life is too short to do what i have to do, It's barely long enough to do what i want to do.** The sooner we start on the want-to, the better.(**人生短得完成不了我必须做的事，人生的长度仅够我完成想做的事，**越早开始我们想做的事越好。)
16 self-concordant(自我和谐)
	* Do it better with pleasure.(愉悦劳作则获多。)
	* There is a lot of research that shows that when we are engaged in a self-concordant goal, we are much more likely to then continue to pursue self-concordant goals, Because it was good that we were more successful; we want more of it , It's self-reinforcing.(有很多研究显示，当我们沉浸于自我和谐的目标时，就会更倾向于继续追求其他自我和谐的目标，因为这样很好，我们更成功了，我们还不满足，这叫自我强化。)

17. Values in action(VIA),
what are your personal character strength?(你的人格力量是什么？)：
* Is this the real me? do i feel authentic, most myself, when i am working on a group? when i am leading people? when i am learning something new? when i am praying? when i am watching a comedy or telling jokes or listening to jokes? when do i feel most myself? William james, back in the 19th century:"I have often thought the best way to define a man's character would be to seek out the particular mental or moral attitude in which, when it came up on him, he felt himself most deeply and intensely active and alive. at such moments there is a voice inside which speaks and says:'This is the real me!'"When is the real you coming out? Is it when you act bravely? Is it when you apply yourself and work hard at something? Is it when you plan-- and you are prudent careful about the future? (这是真的我吗？我是否觉得这真的是我自己，当我在团体里工作时？当我领导别人时？当我学新东西时？当我祈祷时？当我在看一部喜剧，或是讲笑话、听笑话时？我什么时候觉得最是我自己？十九世纪时，William James说：“我时常觉得定义一个人性格最好的办法就是寻找特定的心理，或道德态度，当它们出现时，他觉得自己最为积极和活跃，在这种时刻，他内心有一个声音在说：‘这就是真的我。’”你的真我在什么时候出现呢，是你表现英勇的时候吗？是你全身心投入，认真地做某事的时候吗？是你作为一个审慎的人，你的计划，很好地计划了未来的时候吗？)
two exercises:
* The first is about building capacity 
18. Wrzesniewski:people's perception of work can be classified into three categories.(Wrzesniewski：人们对于工作的概念可以分为三类：)
* The first one: people perceive their work as a job, their motivation is paycheck at the end of the month or the end of the week; work as something i hae to do-- It's a chore, i have no choice about it; what do they expect-- nothing much; they look forward to TGIF or the holiday, the break, the end of the semaster, the end of the two year period, or whatever it may be. （第一类，大部分人认为工作就是工作，他们的动力是每个月末，或者每个周末的工资，工作是我不得不做的事，它是琐事，我别无选择，他们期待什么呢？没有什么，他们期待星期五，期待放假休息，期待学习结束，期待两年研究生结束，或者之类的。）
* The second one: people perceive their work as a career, money and advancement are what motivates these individuals, getting to the next stage; work as-- it's a race, a race to the top, this is what the rat racers mostly reside; the expectation-- more prestige, more power, more money, more prestige, more power, again, advancement, attainment, achievement of the next goal; and the are looking forward to the next promotion.（第二类，有些人认为工作是职业，薪酬和晋升是他们的动力，不断地升值，工作就像赛跑，跑到最高处，这是好胜者常有的情况，他们的期望是更多的特权，更强的力量，更多的钱，更多的特权，更强的力量，晋升，升职，不断地成就，他们寄望的是不断的升职。）
* The third one : people perceive their work as a calling, primarily it doesn't mean that the person who perceives his or her work as a calling does not sometimes experience it as a job, However, overall, they perceive their work as a calling versus a career versus a job. the lucky few who perceive their work as calling , the motivation is the thing in itself, I t's about self-concordant goal, It's also about self-concordant journey; How do they perceive work-- It's a mission, it's a vocation, It's what they are meant to be doing, it's what they want to be doing more than anything else in the world, they see it not as a chore, but it's a privilege to be engaged in what it is that they are doing; their expectations-- their mission: a better world. and finally, what do they look forward to-- more work. more work where they can actualize themselves, where they can fulfill themselves, where they can be-- to use the military cliche-- all they can be. (第三类，少数人认为工作是一种使命,这并不意味着将工作视为使命的人就不会时不时觉得这只是工作，但总体而言，他们认为他们的工作是一种使命，而非职业或仅仅是工作。那些幸运地将工作视为使命的少数人，他们的动力来自于工作本身，是一种自我和谐的目标，是自我和谐的奋斗过程，他们怎么理解工作，他们认为这是种任务，是种使命，他们本就该做这个，做这件事比起所有其他事都更乐意，他们不认为这是琐事，能够参与其中，就是一种特权，他们的期望，也是他们的使命，是使世界更美好，而最后，他们寄望的是更多的工作，从而他们能够实现自身，成就自身，引用军事名言：可以成为任何他们想成为的人。)
19. Important thing also to keep in mind about calling is that well it does depend to some extent on the kind of work that you do. It depends much more on your perception of the work.(关于使命同样要记住的一点是，它确实从某种程度上取决于你工作的种类，但更取决于你对工作的理解。)
20. Abraham Maslow:"It is certainly true that many of us evade our constitutionally suggested vocations(call, destiny, task in life, mission).  So often we run away from the responsibilities dictated(or rather suggested) by nature, by fate, even sometimes by accident, just as jonah tried- in vain- to run away from his fate." Just listen to the voice that suggests your vocation, Just listen to the call that guides you to your calling. What is it? You know the problem is we don't take time to think about these questions. sometimes because we are afraid of the answer, Because what if it is teaching, You know, what about all the pressure that i feel from the outside to go and be a consultant? what about the pressure that i hear from my friends and colleagues who say"well you should do something else more 'noble' with your harvard education." The most noble thing is to listen to that inner voice, Because when we pursue our passions. when we pursue a self-concordant goal and a self-concodant journey, that's when we come alive. and that's when we also make the world a better place. Remember Gandhi:" Be the change you want to see in the world." And if you want a happier world, begin with yourself. (Abraham Maslow:"没错，我们许多人回避了我们天生的职业(使命、命运、天命、职责)，因此我们经常逃脱了一些本性，命运所指定(或者说暗示)的责任，即使有时是意外的，就像Jonah试图逃离他的命运，最终失败了一样" 听从暗示你天命的那个声音，听从指引你使命的召唤，它是什么？问题在于我们没有花时间来思考这些问题，有时候是因为我们害怕得到答案，因为万一你是想去教书呢？而所有来自外界的压力让你去做顾问怎么办？而来自朋友和同事的压力说：“你应该做点别的，用你的哈佛文凭去找更好的工作时的压力”，最好的工作就是听从你的内心，因为当我们追求自己热爱的事业时，当我们追求自我和谐的目标，和自我和谐的奋斗过程时，我们才能真正的活着，才能将世界变得更美好。记得甘地说过：“成为你希望看到的改变。”如果你想让世界更快乐，就要从自己做起。)
21. Ambani Carter:"Instead of focusing on what we can live with, We should be thinking about what we can't live without."(Ambani Carter:"我们不应该专注于生命中可以拥有的，而应该想到那些我们生命中不可或缺的。")
22. a few tips about setting goals:(制定目标的一些建议：)
* First, write them down. you know writing them down is making a commitment, much more of a commitment than just saying them even than just to say them just to ourselves or think about them. But writing them down makes a difference. a lot of research showing the effect of making plans, lists and writing goals.(首先，要把它们写下来，写下来就是做一种承诺，比起只是把它们说出来，最好是公开的把它们说出来，而不是只说给自己听，或者只是想想，但把它们写下来完全不同，很多研究都显示了制定计划、列出并写下目标的作用。)
* Second, set lifelines. you know people talk about deadlines, Tammy, my wife says:"I think it's much more effective, much more useful to set lifelines."Dates by which we hope to achieve those certain goals, Why lifelines? because goals, expecially self-concordant goals are about inspiring us. In other words, putting the spirit inside us. They are about making our life happier. more energetic.(其次，制定最早期限，很多人都会说“最后期限”，我的妻子Tammy说：“我觉得制定最早期限会更有效，更有帮助。”也就是我们希望完成这些目标的日期。为什么要制定最早期限呢，因为目标，尤其是自我和谐的目标是可以激励我们的，换句话说，给我们注入活力，它们使我们的生活更快乐，更具有活力，因此要制定最早期限。)
* third, make them specific. In other words, it's not i am going to improve salse pretty soon or very quickly, but rather  i am going to increase sales 5 percent by December 31, 2008. spicific lifeline as well as specific project. (最后，加上日期，使它们细化。换言之，不是说我马上，或者很快就会提升销量，而是我会在2008年12月31日前使销量增加5%。具体的最早期限，以及具体的目标。)
23. When people had goals and then did not achieve these goals, or achieve these goals and did not set new goals, they will feel enervated, and very often, uninspired. So stretch goals.(当人们有了目标而没有实现这些目标，或者实现了目标却没有制定新目标时，他们就会感到精疲力竭，失去动力。所以，要明确目标。)
# Lesson 13. face the presure(面对压力)
1. The most important thing when dealing with stress is all about cognitive reframing. when dealing with stress, what we need to do is take time out.(当面临压力时最重要的事就是意识重建，我们要做的事就是抽出一些时间。)
2. The conventional question, the traditional psychologist question was "Why are so many people stressed?" An inportant question, good question, question that many great answers but not enough. and then positive psychologists came in. and what they did was ask also the positive question. Just like "What do those who were successful and able to lead a healthy and happy life do?" In other words, focusing on what works. In other words, focusing on tip of the stem. Because while most people are stressed, not all of them are. There are people who are able to be successful and at the same time, lead a health and happy life. what do they do? what is it about them? Here is what they do:what was found was that there are some distinguishing characteristics- two of them: first, they set rituals for themselves; the second thing they do- and this it what i am going to elaborate on now is in addition to having rituals, whether it's a lot of rituals or a few rituals, depending on individual needs and differences. **they particularly set rituals for both work and for recovery.**Let me explain, what i am going to say now is something that psychologists did not see before, because it was hidden just like the children on the bus or hidden by the first question. It was only after asking the second question that they notice this, **what they noticed was that these individuals ritualize work and recovery and in essence what they found- this is the most surprising result in my mind in study stress is that sress was actually not the problem, we were looking in the wrong place, In fact, what they found was stress was good for us! The stress actually cultivated resilience, strength and helped us be happier in the long run.** wait a minute, what does that mean? well, think about the following analogy, Think about the physical realm. what actually happens to you when you go to the gym? when you go to the gym, you lift weights, what are you doing to your muscle? You are stressing your muscle! In fact, you are carrying part of the- there
are micro tears in your cells. Now is this a bad thing? That you are doing that? Not at all! It's a good thing. Because you lift weights and then two days later, you lift these weights again. And the next week, you continue lifting these weights, and on and on, you do it for a month and two and four months and six months, and after a year of lifting weights, you begin to look like me! or maybe not, So the stress part is actually good for us. what's the problem though? when do the problems begin with stressing those muscles? It's when you lift weights, and a minute later, you lift the same weights again, and again, and again, and again, and so on and so on. what would happen to you then, if you don't take a break, whether it's a break between sessions, whether it's break, days break? what happens to you then? That's when you get injured. That's when you get hurt. That's when you actually tear or pull a muscle, That's when you become over worked, and that has psychological as well as physical effects. That's when you are over trained. **In other words, the problem is not stress, not on the physical level, nor on the psychological level, The problem is lack of recovery.** Individuals who are both successful, happy, thriving, flourishing are ones who do experience stress. However, they also pay very close attention to recovery. Just like any athlete here in this room knows that you have tapering, you have time-off before important games. you don't lift the same weights day in and day out. The same thing on the psychological level, if we don't take breaks, we will pay a price- on the physical level, we get injured; on the psychological level, we experience anxiety, ultimately, potentially depression. **stress is fine, It's good, It's exciting at times, if we also have recovery.**(传统的问题，传统的心理学家会问：“为什么这么多人压力过大？”这是非常重要的，非常好的问题，能够引出很多好的回答，但仍然不够，然后积极心理学出现了，而他们所做的是，同样问一些积极的问题，就像“那些成功的、过着健康快乐生活的人是怎么做的？”换句话说，关注起作用的事物，也就是关注尖端的芽，因为虽然很多人都压力过大，但不是所有人都这样，有一些人能够很成功，同时过着健康和快乐的生活，他们是怎么做的？他们做了些什么？他们是这样做的：人们发现，他们有一些特别的特质，有两点：第一，他们为自己建立例行公事；第二件事，也就是我现在要详细讲的，除了建立例行公事，不管是很多的例行公事，还是寥寥几件，视乎个人需要和个人差异，**除了建立例行公事，他们还特别地不仅为工作，还为恢复也建立了例行公事。**让我来解释下，我现在要说的是心理学家以前没有意识到的，因为它就像公车上的孩子一样隐藏，或者被第一个问题掩盖着，只有问了第二个问题，他们才会注意到，**他们注意到这些人将工作和恢复例行公事化，本质上他们发现的是，这是我觉得研究压力时所得的最惊人的结果，那就是问题其实不在于压力，我们找错了地方，事实上他们发现压力对我们是有好处的，压力实际上培养了我们的忍耐性、力量，并且从长远来讲让我们更快乐。**稍等片刻，这是什么意思呢？想想下面这个类比，想想运动方面，你去健身房时实际上发生了什么呢？当你去健身房，你举重时，你对你的肌肉做了什么？你在给你的肌肉压力！事实上，你其实就在... 你的细胞在偷偷流泪，请问这是坏事吗？你所做的事是坏事吗？完全不是，这是件好事，因为你举重，然后两天之后，再去举重，然后下周，你接着举重，长此以往，你举了一个月、两个月、四个、六个月，然后举了一年的重之后，你就会像我一样，或者也不会，所以压力其实对我们是有好处的，那真正的问题是什么？比如说压缩肌肉时，问题是从什么时候开始的呢？是你去举重，然后一分钟之后，你又去举重，然后不断举，不断举，不断不断地举，然后会发生的事就是，如果你不休息，不管是运动之间的休息，或者是休息几天，那么会发生什么呢？你就会受伤，那时你就会受伤，你的肌肉就会拉伤，那时你就会锻炼过度，这既是生理上的，也有心理上的影响，这时候你就是锻炼过度了。**换言之，问题不在于压力，不是生理上的问题，也不是心理上的问题，问题在于缺少恢复。**那些即成功有快乐幸福的人是会感受到压力的，然而他们很注重恢复，就好像在座的任何运动员都知道，你们会有调整期，在重要比赛前都会有休息，你们不会每天去举重，从心理层面上讲也是这样，如果我们不懂得休息，我们会付出代价，在生理层面上，我们会受伤，在心理层面上，我们会感到焦虑，最终可能导致抑郁。**压力没有关系，它是好事，如果我们能恢复，它有时甚至是很令人兴奋的。**)
3. Tony Schwartz and Jim Loehr: **what we need to do is change our perception of our day, from being marathon runners to being sprinters, from going on and on and on, to sprinting, recovery, sprinting, recovery.** That understanding changed my life, I was a marathon runner, metaphorically- meaning at work, I used to work 14 hours a day, I loved my work, I worked extremely hard. and then i decided to get married and to have children, and i knew that things would change as a result of that, and i said:"OK, i have to compromise. i have to work less than 14 hours a day if i want to maintain a healthy relationship with my spouse and with my kids."and it disappointed me to some extent, but i have my priorities. and i made a choice. and then i met Tony Schwartz, who within a few minutes changed my perception, my understanding of what my day can and ought to look like. and when he explained to me this, it made immediate sense. I Started to implement it, and today i may not be as productive as i was when i worked for 14 hours a day, but very close to it. And i am certainly happier. and i am more creative than i was when i was a marathoner. and **here is his suggestion: One of the things that he talks about in the book, this is a ritual that i recommend and it is:have 60 to 120 minutes, so around 90 minutes, of sprint, work, concentrate, focus hard, go for it. and then after that, after you sprint, with as little distraction as possible, have 15 minutes or so of recovery.** what psychologist found is essentially we are able to sprint, to focus, according to our bio-rhythms between 60 and 120 minutes- it differs. some people are more 60; others can do it for two hours, Average: 90 minutes, After you sprint, take 15 minutes off, whether it's for meditation, listening to your favorite piece of music, whether it's for going to the gym, having lunch, having a break- and during lunch, not doing emails and being on the phone, which only adds to the stress, really relaxing with friends or by ourselves, and when we have a day that tructured with sprint, recovery, sprint, recovery, that's when we can sustain, when we have a higher levels of energy, when we get the most done and when we are happiest. this is my day now. my day comprises sprint, recovery, sprint, recovery. I'm able to get so much more done, my ideal day, work day is 90 minutes, 15minutes meditation; 90 minutes, lunch; 90 minutes, work out; 90 minutes, home with family. Actually net- i work for 6 hours a day, But in those 6 hours, I get more than i would have in 10- not to mention the fact that i am happier and more creative doing it. **The key when doing it is to maintain flexibility**, Because the ideal day for me would be that, However, there are other things you know- i travel a lot, i teach a class, during those times, let's say i am not by my computer, writing or doing research- again, because these are important things to me. so what would i have done for example is say i want ten 90 minutes sessions, the ritual of ten 90 minutes session a week. some of these 90 minutes sessions are on a flight and that's ok, some of these 90 minutes sessions are at home or in my office. But at lease ten, usually more than ten 90 minutes sessions a week. And when i have it, i am happy, i feel good. i get a lot done. also, the ritual of yoga, maintain flexibility there, so one of the things that are difficult for me is to introduce a 45 minutes or one hour session a day, and yoga is important for me, so what i started to do was breaking down yoga sessions and  now part of my 15 minutes in between is 15 minute yoga, sunset, and then the next 15 minutes is another part of yoga practice. so i break yoga into two or three sessions a day instead of one. **Again, the flexibility of ritual.****the key is to attain multi-level recovery. First recovery: on the micro level, 15 minutes meditation, one hour of gym, whatever it is, a lunch break. Middle: mezo level recovery and that is a good night sleep, sleep is important, a day off during the week. Even God needed a day off. Implemented in our lives. and finally, those vacations. Remember J.P.Morgan:"I can do the work of a year in 0 months, but not in 12." Recreation leads to creation.** and that for me works. works very well.(Tony Schwartz and Jim Loehr:"**我们所要做的是将我们对生活的理解从马拉松运动员变为短跑运动员，从不停地跑、跑、跑，变为短跑――恢复――短跑――恢复。"**这个想法改变了我的人生，我曾经是个马拉松运动员，我是指在工作上，我每天工作14小时，我热爱我的工作，非常努力，然后我决定结婚生子，我知道因此可能一切会变得不一样，然后我说：“好吧，我必须妥协，我只能一天工作少于14小时，如果我想和我的妻子以及孩子保持良好的关系的话。”某种程度上有点失望，但我有我优先的考虑，我做了这样的决定，然后我遇到了Tony Schwartz,他只用了几分钟就改变了我的观念，改变了我对我的人生应该是怎么样的理解，当他跟我说时，我立即意识到就应该是这样的，我开始运用它，而今天我可能没有一天工作14小时，那么有效率，但也十分接近了，而我显然更快乐了，我比还是个“马拉松运动员”时更有创造力。**他的建议是这样的：他在书里讲到这样一个东西，这是我推荐的一种习惯，用一到两个小时，也就是大约一个半小时来“短跑”专注地工作，精力非常集中，然后在那之后，“短跑”之后，在尽可能少分心的情况下，用十五分钟来恢复。**心理学家发现我们能够“短跑”，能够专注，按照我们的生物钟，能持续一到两个小时，每个人可能不同，有些人是一个小时，有些人可以持续两个小时，平均是一个半小时，“短跑”之后，休息十五分钟，可以是冥想，听你最喜欢的音乐，也可以是去健身，吃午饭，休息一下，但在午饭时，不收邮件，不接电话，那些只会增加焦虑，而是和朋友一起或独自完全放松，如果我们的一天是短跑――恢复――短跑――恢复，我们就能持续，能够维持高水平的精力，做更多的工作，并且更快乐。我现在的生活就是如此，我的一天就是短跑――恢复――短跑――恢复，我能做更多的工作，我理想的一天就是一个半小时的工作，十五分钟冥想；一个半小时，午餐；一个半小时，运动；一个半小时，回家和家人在一起；我一天净工作6个小时，但在这6个小时中，我能做比十个小时还多的事，更不用说我更快乐，并且更有创造性了。**这样的关键在于维持灵活性。**因为--对我来说理想的一天是这样的，然而总是有一些别的事，比如我经常出差，我要教课，在这种时候，我不在电脑旁，我要是个一个半小时的时间段，例行的每周是个一个半小时时间段，有一些这种时间段是在飞机上，这没关系，有一些时间段我在家里或者在办公室里，但每周至少要有十个，通常多于十个一个半小时的时间段，当我做到时，我很快乐，我感觉很好，我做了很多事。又比如瑜伽的习惯，维持灵活性，对我来说很困难的一件事就是每天留出45分钟或者一个小时的时间段，但瑜伽对我很重要，它使我感觉良好，所以我所做的是，拆分瑜伽的时间段，现在那15分钟的间隔有时是15分钟的瑜伽，15分钟的日落瑜伽，然后下一个15分钟做另一种瑜伽练习，所以我将瑜伽拆分成每天两到三个时间段，**又是例行公事的灵活性。**这对我来说有用，非常有效。**关键在于保证不同程度的恢复，第一种恢复：从最小的级别，15分钟的冥想，1小时健身，或者是午餐休息，随便什么；中间级别的恢复：就是睡一个好觉，我们会讲到睡觉的重要性，睡眠是对幸福、对快乐、对创造力，以及对你的记忆力的重要投资。睡眠很重要，每周都要休息一天，即使上帝也需要一天的休息，我们的生活也是这样；最后：就是假期，J.P.Morgan说过：“我可以一年工作9个月，但不能工作12个月。”****娱乐带来创造力**，记住这点。)
